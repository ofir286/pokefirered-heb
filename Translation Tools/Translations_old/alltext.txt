I came here with some friends to
catch us some BUG POKéMON
hey’re all itching to get into
some POKéMON battles!

Hey! You have POKéMON!
Come on!
Let’s battle ’em!

No!
CATERPIE can’t hack it!

Ssh! You’ll scare the bugs away.
Another time, okay?

Yo!
You can’t jam out if you’re a
POKéMON TRAINER!

Huh?
I ran out of POKéMON!

That totally stinks! I’m going to
catch some stronger ones!

Hey, wait up!
What’s the hurry? Why the rush?

I give!
You’re good at this!

Sometimes, you can find stuff on
the ground
’m looking for the stuff I
dropped. Can you help me?

I might be little, but I won’t like
it if you go easy on me!

Oh, boo.
Nothing went right.

I lost some of my allowance…

Did you know that POKéMON evolve?

Oh!
I lost!

BUG POKéMON evolve quickly.
They’re a lot of fun!

I was throwing POKé BALLS to
catch POKéMON, and I ran out
hat’s why you can never have too
many POKé BALLS.

TRAINER TIP
f your POKéMON are weak and you
want to avoid battles, stay away
from grassy areas!

For poison, use ANTIDOTE!
Get it at POKéMON MARTS!

TRAINER TIP
ontact PROF. OAK via a PC to
get your POKéDEX evaluated!

TRAINER TIP
ou can’t catch a POKéMON that
belongs to someone else
hrow POKé BALLS only at wild
POKéMON to catch them!

TRAINER TIP
eaken POKéMON before attempting
capture
hen healthy, they may escape!

LEAVING VIRIDIAN FOREST
PEWTER CITY AHEAD

WHOA!
You shocked me!
…Oh, you’re just a kid!

Wow!
Shocked again!

Kids like you shouldn’t be
wandering around here in the dark.

Did you come to explore the cave,
too?

Losing stinks!
It’s so uncool.

I came all the way down here to
show off to girls.

Wow! It’s way bigger in here than
I thought!

Oh!
I lost it!

How do you get out of here?
It’s so big, I may get lost.

What!
Don’t sneak up on me!

My POKéMON won’t do!

I have to find stronger POKéMON.
Where might they be?

What?
I’m waiting for my friends to find
me here.

I lost?

I came because I heard there are
some very rare fossils here.

Suspicious men are in the cave.
What about you?

You got me!

I saw them!
I’m sure they’re from TEAM ROCKET!

You need to go through this cave
to get to CERULEAN CITY.

I lost.

ZUBAT is tough!
But if you can catch one, you’ll
be able to count on it.

Beware!
ZUBAT is a bloodsucker!

Hi, I’m excavating for fossils here
under MT. MOON
ometimes, BROCK of PEWTER GYM
lends me a hand.

Hey, stop
 found these fossils!
They’re both mine!

Okay!
I’ll share!

We’ll each take a fossil!
No being greedy!

All right.
Then this fossil is mine!

Far away, on CINNABAR ISLAND,
there’s a POKéMON LAB
hey do research on regenerating
fossils.

We, TEAM ROCKET, shall find the
fossils
eviving POKéMON from them will
earn us huge riches!

Urgh!
Now I’m mad!

You made me mad!
TEAM ROCKET will blacklist you!

We, TEAM ROCKET, are POKéMON
gangsters!
We strike fear with our strength!

I blew it!

Darn it all!
My associates won’t stand for this!

We’re pulling a big job here!
Get lost, kid!

So, you are good…

If you find a fossil, give it to me
and scram!

Little kids shouldn’t be messing
around with grown-ups
t could be bad news!

I’m steamed!

POKéMON lived here long before
people came.

Do you want the DOME FOSSIL?

Do you want the HELIX FOSSIL?

Obtained the HELIX FOSSIL!

Obtained the DOME FOSSIL!

Bonjour!
I am le waiter on this ship
 will be happy to serve you
anything you please
 … …
Ah! Le strong silent type!

The passengers are restless from
this long voyage
ou might be challenged by the
more bored ones!

This ship, she is a luxury liner for
TRAINERS of the world
t every port, we hold parties with
invited TRAINERS.

{GREEN}: Bonjour!
{RED}
magine seeing you here!
{RED}, were you really invited
o how’s your POKéDEX coming
 already caught 40 kinds, pal.
Different kinds are everywhere
rawl around in grassy areas, and
look hard for them.

Humph
t least you’re raising your
POKéMON!

{GREEN}: I heard there was a CUT
master on board
ut he was just a seasick old man
UT itself is really useful.
Yup, it’ll be handy
ou should go see him, too.
Smell ya!

Our CAPTAIN is a sword master.
He’s awesome at using CUT
hey say he even teaches CUT
to POKéMON!

The party’s over.
The ship will be departing soon.

Whew!
Scrubbing decks is hard work!

Urf… I feel ill
 got seasick, so I stepped out to
get some air…

Hey, matey
et’s do a little jig!

You’re impressive!

How many kinds of POKéMON do you
think there are in this big world?

Ahoy, there!
Are you seasick?

I was just careless!

My pa said there are 100 kinds of
POKéMON. I think there are more.

You, mon petit!
We’re busy here!
Out of the way!

I saw an odd BERRY in the trash.
I wonder what that was?

I’m so busy I’m getting dizzy!
You have to give me room here!

Hum-de-hum-de-ho
 peel spuds every day!
Hum-hum…

Did you hear about SNORLAX?
It’s a glutton
o other POKéMON eats and sleeps
the way SNORLAX can and does!

Snivel… Sniff
 only get to peel onions…
Snivel…

Er-hem!
Indeed I am le CHEF
e main course is

Salmon du Salad
es guests may gripe it’s fish
again, however!

Eels au Barbecue
es guests will mutiny, I fear.

Prime Beefsteak
ut, have I enough fillets du
beef?

CAPTAIN: Ooargh…
I feel hideous…
Urrp! Seasick…

{RED} rubbed the CAPTAIN’s
back
ub-rub…
Rub-rub…

CAPTAIN: Whew! Thank you!
I’m feeling much better now
ou want to see my hidden CUT
technique
 could show you my prized CUT
technique if I weren’t so ill
 know! You can have this!
This HIDDEN MACHINE
each CUT to your POKéMON, and
you can see it CUT anytime!

{RED} obtained HM01
from the CAPTAIN!

Using CUT, you can chop down
small trees
hy not try it with the trees
around VERMILION CITY?

CAPTAIN: …Whew
ow that I’m not sick anymore,
I guess it’s time
he S.S. ANNE will set sail soon
arewell, until our return to
VERMILION CITY!

Oh, no!
You have no room for this!

Yuck!
Shouldn’t have looked!

How to Conquer Seasickness…
The CAPTAIN’s reading this!

Ssh…!
I’m a GLOBAL POLICE agent
’m on the trail of TEAM ROCKET.
They’re up to nothing good!

I love POKéMON!
Do you?

Wow! 
You’re great!

Listen, listen!
Let me be your friend, okay
hen we can trade POKéMON and
do stuff.

I collected these POKéMON
from all around the world!

Oh, no!
I went around the world for these!

You hurt my poor POKéMON
 demand that you heal them at a
POKéMON CENTER!

We are cruising around the world,
my children and I.

A world cruise is so elegant yet
cozy!

I always travel with WIGGLYTUFF.
I never leave home without it.

WIGGLYTUFF: Puup pupuu!

Waiter, I would like a cherry pie,
please!

Waitress, I would like a cherry
pie, please!

You insolent pup!
How dare you barge in!

Humph! You rude child!
You have no sense of courtesy!

I wish to be left alone!
Get out!

I am but a solitary traveler
y sole companions and friends are
POKéMON I caught on my journeys…

My, my friends…

You should be nice to friends!

I’ve journeyed far and wide, but in
all my travels I’ve never seen
any POKéMON sleep like this one
t was something like this!

Competing against the young keeps
me youthful.

Good match!
Ah, I feel young again!

Fifteen years ago, I would
have won!

Check out what I fished up!

I’m all out!

Party
he cruise ship’s party should be
over by now.

Ah, yes, I have seen some POKéMON
ferry people across the water!

Small trees can be chopped down
using the move CUT
ut remember this!
CUT is an HM technique
nce learned, it is not so easily
discarded.

Which do you find more worthy,
a strong or a rare POKéMON?

I must salute you!

Personally, I prefer strong and
rare POKéMON.

I don’t believe I saw you at the
party?

Take it easy!

Oh, I adore your strong POKéMON!
Oh, how I envy you for them!

Have you gone to the SAFARI ZONE
in FUCHSIA CITY
here are many kinds of rare
POKéMON.

Me and my daddy think the SAFARI
ZONE is awesome!
I wish we could go there again.

The CAPTAIN said he’s awfully sick.
He was all pale.

I hear many people get seasick.

Matey, you’re walking the plank if
you lose!

Argh!
Beaten by a kid!

When we’re out at sea, jellyfish
POKéMON sometimes drift by.

Hello, stranger
 can’t tell if you’re from the seas
or mountains, but stop and chat
ll my POKéMON are from the sea.

Darn!
I let that one get away!

I was going to make you my
assistant, too!

Even us sailors have POKéMON, too!

Okay, you’re not bad.

We caught all our POKéMON while
we were out at sea.

I like feisty kids like you!

Argh!
Lost it!

Sea POKéMON live in deep water.
You’ll need a ROD to fish them up!

You know what they say about
sailors and battling!

Right!
Good battle, mate!

Hahaha!
Want to be a sailor, mate?

Come on, then!
My sailor’s pride is at stake!

Your spirit sank me!

Did you see the FISHING GURU in
VERMILION CITY?

My buddy MACHOKE is super strong
e has enough STRENGTH to move
big rocks!

MACHOKE: Gwoh! Goggoh!

You look tired. Would you like to
take a short rest?

I’m glad to see that everyone is
looking refreshed and chipper.

Oh, I’m sorry for fussing over you.
You look like my little brother…

Oh, I’m sorry for fussing over you.
You look like my little sister…

People often lose things in the
darkness of the UNDERGROUND PATH.

I heard a sleepy POKéMON appeared
out near CELADON CITY, too.

The DEPARTMENT STORE in CELADON
has a great selection
o you go there very often?

I went inside ROCK TUNNEL, but it’s
pitch-black and scary in there
f I could get a POKéMON to use
FLASH and light it up…

Well, isn’t this a surprise!
DIGLETT dug this long tunnel
t goes right to VIRIDIAN CITY,
they tell me.

I wonder if you are good enough
for me?

I lost out…

I never wanted to lose to anybody,
especially to a younger kid…

I can see you’re good.
Let me see exactly how good!

I had a chance…

Tch!
I concede, you are better than I!

If you can get through here,
you can go meet the ELITE FOUR.

No!
Unbelievable!

I can beat you when it comes to
knowledge about POKéMON!

This here is VICTORY ROAD.
It’s the final test for TRAINERS!

Atcho!

If you get stuck, try moving some
boulders around.

Ah, so you wish to challenge the
ELITE FOUR?

You got me!

{GREEN} also came through here.

Come on!
I’ll whip you!

I got whipped!

You earned the right to be on
VICTORY ROAD…

Is VICTORY ROAD too tough?

Well done!

Many TRAINERS give up their
challenge here and go home.

You should be proud of yourself,
having battled your way through
VICTORY ROAD so courageously
n recognition of your feat,
I’ll teach you DOUBLE-EDGE
ould you like me to teach that
technique?

I’ll teach you the technique
anytime.

Which POKéMON should I teach
DOUBLE-EDGE?

Keep that drive going for the
POKéMON LEAGUE
ake a run at them and knock ’em
out!

I heard rumors of a child prodigy.

The rumors were true!

So, it was you who beat GIOVANNI
of TEAM ROCKET?

TRAINERS live to seek stronger
opponents.

Oh!
So strong!

By fighting tough battles, you get
stronger.

I’ll show you just how good you
are. Not!

I’m furious!

You showed me just how good
I was…

Only the chosen can pass here!

I don’t believe it!

All TRAINERS here are headed to
the POKéMON LEAGUE
on’t let down your guard.

RAY: Together, the two of us are
destined for greatness!

RAY: Ludicrous!
This can’t be!

RAY: You’ve beaten us.
Greatness remains elusive…

RAY: Together, the two of us are
striving for the pinnacle
e need you to bring two POKéMON
into battle with us.

TYRA: We’re trying to become
champions together.

TYRA: Oh, but…

TYRA: You’ve taught me that power
can be infinite in shape and form.

TYRA: You can’t battle with us if
you have only one POKéMON.

Who are you?
How did you get here?

Oww!
Beaten!

Blast it… You’re dissing TEAM
ROCKET, aren’t you?

You broke into TEAM ROCKET’s
operation? What nerve!

Boom!

You’re not going to get away with
this, brat!

Intruder alert!

I can’t do it!

SILPH SCOPE? Humph!
I don’t know where it is.

Why did you come here?

This won’t do!

Okay, I’ll talk…
Take the elevator to see my BOSS.

Are you lost, you little mouse?

Why…?

Uh-oh, that ruckus somehow opened
the door!

BOSS said you can see ghosts with
the SILPH SCOPE.

I surrender!

The TEAM ROCKET HQ has four
underground floors
hink you can reach the BOSS?

Stop meddling in TEAM ROCKET’s
affairs or else!

Oof!
Taken down!

SILPH SCOPE?
Oh, that machine the BOSS stole
t’s here somewhere.

We got word from upstairs that you
were coming!

What?
I lost? No!

Go ahead and go
ut you can’t run the elevator
without the LIFT KEY.

So! I must say, I am impressed you
got here
EAM ROCKET captures POKéMON from
around the world
hey’re important tools for keeping
our criminal enterprise going
 am the leader, GIOVANNI
or your insolence, you will feel a
world of pain!

WHAT!
This can’t be!

I see that you raise POKéMON with
utmost care
 child like you would never
understand what I hope to achieve
 shall step aside this time
 hope we meet again…

I know you!
You ruined our plans at MT. MOON!

Burned again!

Do you have something against TEAM
ROCKET?

How can you not see the beauty of
our evil?

Ayaya!

BOSS!
I’m sorry I failed you!

The elevator doesn’t work?
Who has the LIFT KEY?

No!

Oh, no!
I dropped the LIFT KEY!

It appears to need a key.

Welcome
he PRESIDENT is in the boardroom
on 11F.

SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE

Help!
I’m a SILPH employee.

How did you know
I was a ROCKET?

I work for both SILPH and TEAM
ROCKET.

It’s off-limits here!
Go home!

You’re good.

Can you solve the maze in here?
It’s not easy, I tell you!

No kids are allowed in here!

Tough!

Diamond-shaped tiles are teleport
blocks
hey’re transporters for this
high-tech building.

Hey, kid!
What are you wandering here for?

I goofed!

SILPH CO. will be associated with
TEAM ROCKET!

Eeek!
No! Stop! Help
h, you’re not with TEAM ROCKET.
I’m sorry, I thought
ill you forgive me if I teach
you the THUNDER WAVE technique?

Oh…
But THUNDER WAVE is convenient…

Which POKéMON should I teach
THUNDER WAVE?

THUNDER WAVE causes paralysis in
the target POKéMON
 paralyzed POKéMON may be unable
to move in battle
t’s an ELECTRIC-type move, so it
won’t work on some POKéMON.

SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE

I work for SILPH CO.
What am I to do?

{RED}!
You and your POKéMON saved us!

Quit messing with us, kid!

I support TEAM ROCKET more than
I support SILPH CO.!

You really got me!

Humph
EAM ROCKET said that if I helped

Sssh!
Can’t you see I’m hiding?

Huh?
TEAM ROCKET is gone?

TEAM ROCKET has taken control
of SILPH CO.!

Arrgh!

Fwahahaha!
My BOSS has been after this place!

My POKéMON is my loyal servant.

Darn!
You weak POKéMON!

The doors are electronically
locked
t takes a CARD KEY to open the
doors here.

Intruder spotted!

TEAM ROCKET is in an uproar over
some intruder
hat’s you, right?

TEAM ROCKET took off!
You’re our hero! Thank you!

I heard a kid was wandering
around.

Boom!

It’s not smart to pick a fight with
TEAM ROCKET!

We study POKé BALL technology on
this floor.

Dang!
Blast it!

We worked on the ultimate POKé
BALL which would catch anything.

Whaaat
here shouldn’t be any children
here!

Oh, goodness!

You’re only on 5F.
It’s a long way to my BOSS!

Show TEAM ROCKET a little respect!

Cough…
Cough…

Those thugs that took over our
building
heir BOSS said he was looking for
strong POKéMON
 hope our PRESIDENT managed to
avoid trouble…

The ROCKETS came and took over
the building!

Well, better get back to work.

Oh dear, oh dear.
Help me, please!

We got engaged.
Heheh!

That man next to me…
He’s such a coward!

He’s so helpless, he needed
someone like me to look after him.

TEAM ROCKET is trying to conquer
the world with POKéMON.

TEAM ROCKET ran away, and it’s all
because of you!

They must have targeted SILPH for
our POKéMON products.

Come work for SILPH when you
get older.

I am one of the four ROCKET
BROTHERS!

Flame out!

No matter!
My brothers will avenge me!

That rotten PRESIDENT
erves him right for shipping me
off to the TIKSI BRANCH
hat’s why TEAM ROCKET came after
us, I’m sure of it!

Shoot!

TIKSI BRANCH?
It’s in Russian no-man’s-land!

You dare betray TEAM ROCKET?

You traitor!

If you stand for justice, you
betray us bad guys!

SILPH CO. HEAD OFFICE

Oh! Hi! You’re not a ROCKET!
You came to save us?
Why, thank you
 want you to have this POKéMON
for saving us.

{RED} obtained a LAPRAS from
the SILPH employee!

It’s a LAPRAS.
It’s a very intelligent POKéMON
e kept it in our lab, but it will
be much better off with you
 think you will be a good TRAINER
for LAPRAS
t’s a good swimmer.
It’ll give you a lift across water!

TEAM ROCKET’s BOSS went to the
boardroom
s our PRESIDENT okay?
I’m worried.

TEAM ROCKET was after the MASTER
BALL, which catches any POKéMON.

We canceled the MASTER BALL
project because of TEAM ROCKET.

It would be bad if TEAM ROCKET
took over SILPH or our POKéMON.

Wow
ou chased off TEAM ROCKET all by
yourself?

You!
It’s really dangerous here
ou came to save me?
You can’t!

Thank you so much!

Uh-oh!
I smell a little mouse!

Lights out!

You won’t find my BOSS by just
scurrying around!

Heheh
ou mistook me for a SILPH worker?

I’m done!

Despite your age, you are a
skilled TRAINER!

I am one of the four ROCKET
BROTHERS!

Aack!
Brothers, I lost!

Doesn’t matter.
My brothers will repay the favor!

A child intruder?
That must be you!

Fine!
I lost!

Go on home before my BOSS gets
ticked off!

{GREEN}: What kept you, {RED}?

{GREEN}: Hahaha! I thought you’d
turn up if I waited here
 guess TEAM ROCKET slowed you
down! Not that I care
 saw you in SAFFRON, so I decided
to see if you got better!

Oh, man!
So, you are ready for BOSS
ROCKET!

Well, {RED}!
I’m moving on up and ahead

Huh?

Don’t give up!

Thank you so much.

Your POKéMON seem to adore you,
kid!

Ghaaah!

If I had started as a TRAINER at
your age…

Your POKéMON have weak points!
I can nail them!

You hammered me!

Exploiting weak spots does work.

hat makes this all worthwhile.

Whew!
I’m tired from all the fun!

You can keep any item you find in
the SAFARI ZONE
ut, you’ll run out of time if you
try for all of them at once.

Go to the deepest part of the
SAFARI ZONE. You will win a prize!

My EEVEE evolved into FLAREON
ut, a friend’s EEVEE turned into a
VAPOREON. I wonder why?

The SAFARI ZONE’s huge, wouldn’t
you say
UCHSIA’s GYM LEADER, KOGA, 
patrols the grounds every so often
hanks to him, we can play here
knowing that we’re safe.

Tossing ROCKS at POKéMON might
make them run, but they’ll be
easier to catch.

Using BAIT will make POKéMON more
likely to stick around if they get
busy eating.

I hiked a lot, but I didn’t see any
POKéMON I wanted.

Ah! Finally
ou’re the first person to reach
the SECRET HOUSE
lthough I made a campaign
for our grand opening
 was getting worried that no one
would win our campaign prize
ongratulations!
You have won!

{RED} received HM03
from the attendant!

HM03 is SURF
OKéMON will be able to ferry you
across water using it
nd, this HM isn’t disposable, so
you can use it over and over
ou’re super lucky for winning this
fabulous prize!

You don’t have room for this
fabulous prize!

Mew!

This tunnel goes a long way, kid!

Doh!
You win!

Watch for ONIX.
They appear only occasionally
igh-level ones can put the
squeeze on you!

Hmm.
Maybe I’m lost in here…

Ease up!
What am I doing?
Which way is out?

That sleeping POKéMON on ROUTE 12
forced me to take this detour.

Outsiders like you need to show me
some respect!

I give!

You’re talented enough to hike!

POKéMON fight!
Ready, go!

Game over!

Oh well, I’ll get a ZUBAT as I go!

Eek
on’t try anything funny in the
dark!

It was too dark…

I saw a MACHOP in this tunnel.

I came this far looking for wild
POKéMON.

I’m out of POKéMON!

You looked cute and harmless.
Was I ever wrong!

You have POKéMON!
Let’s start!

You play hard!

Whew!
I’m all sweaty now.

ROCK TUNNEL
CERULEAN CITY - LAVENDER TOWN

Do you know how you can avoid
getting lost in the mountains
ou can bend twigs as trail
markers.

Ohhh!
I did my best!

I want to go home!

Hahaha!
Can you beat my power?

Oops!
Outmuscled!

I go for power because I hate
thinking.

You have a POKéDEX?
I want one, too.

Shoot!
I am so jealous!

When you finish your POKéDEX,
can I have it?

Um… Do you know about POKéMON
cosplay?

Well, that’s that.

POKéMON cosplay is dressing up as
POKéMON for fun
LEFAIRY is a favorite.

My POKéMON techniques will leave
you crying!

I give!
You’re a better technician!

In mountains, you’ll often find
ROCK-type POKéMON.

I don’t often come here, but I will
battle you.

Oh!
I lost!

I like tiny POKéMON.
Big ones are too scary!

Hit me with your best shot!

Fired away!

I’ll raise my POKéMON to beat
yours, kid.

I draw illustrations of POKéMON
when I’m home.

Whew…
I’m exhausted…

I’m an artist, not a fighter.
I’ll go home to draw.

When you’re up on a rocky mountain
like this, rockslides are a threat
an you imagine?
Boulders tumbling down on you
hat’d be, like, waaaaaaaaaaah!
Total terror
ou don’t seem to be scared.
Want to try using ROCK SLIDE?

Oh, so you are scared after all.

Which POKéMON should I teach
ROCK SLIDE?

It might be scary to use it in this
tunnel…

Hint: Boulders might change the
flow of water.

DANGER
Fast current!

POKéMON TOWER was erected in the
memory of POKéMON that died.

Did you come to pay respects
less your POKéMON-loving heart,
son.

Did you come to pay respects
less your POKéMON-loving heart,
girl.

I came to pray for my dearly
departed CLEFAIRY
niff!
I’m awash in tears…

My GROWLITHE…
Why did you die?

I am a CHANNELER
here are spirits up to mischief.
I sense them high in the TOWER.

{GREEN}: Hey, {RED}!
What brings you here?
Is your POKéMON dead
ey! It’s alive
 can at least make them faint!
Let’s go!

What?
You stinker
 took it easy on you, too!

How’s your POKéDEX coming?
I just caught a CUBONE
 can’t find the bigger MAROWAK.
Where could they be
 bet there aren’t any left
ell, I better get going.
I’ve got a lot to accomplish,
unlike you
mell ya later!

Even we could not identify the
wayward ghosts
 SILPH SCOPE might be able to
unmask them.

Urrg… Awaa…
Huhu… Graa…

Hwa!
I’m saved!

The ghosts can be identified by
the SILPH SCOPE.

Kekeke…
Kwaaah!

Hmm?
What am I doing?

Sorry!
I was possessed!

Be gone!
Malevolent spirit!

Whew!
The spirit left!

The others above…
They must have been possessed.

Ghost! No!
Kwaaah!

Where is the ghost?

I must have been dreaming…

Be cursed with me!
Kwaaah!

What!

We can’t determine the identity of
the ghosts…

Huhuhu…
Beat me not!

Huh?
Who? What?

May the departed POKéMON rest in
peace…

Come, child!
I have purified this space.
You can rest here.

Give…me…
your…all…

Gasp!

I was under possession.

You…shall…
join…us…

What a nightmare!

I was possessed.

Zombies!

Ha?

I regained my senses.

Urgah…
Urff…

Whoo!

I fell to evil spirits despite my
training in the mountains…

Entered the purified and protected
zone
RED}’s POKéMON were fully
healed.

Give…me…
blood…

Groan!

I feel anemic and weak…

Urff…
Kwaah!

Something fell out!

My hair didn’t fall out!
It was a malevolent spirit!

Ke…ke…ke…
ke…ke…ke!

Keee!

What’s going on here?

Be gone…
Intruders…

The ghost was the restless spirit
of CUBONE’s mother!

The mother’s spirit was calmed
t departed to the afterlife…

What do you want?
Why are you here?

I give up!

I’m not going to forget this!

This old guy marched right up to
our HIDEOUT
hen, he starts ranting about how
TEAM ROCKET’s abusing POKéMON
o, we’re just talking it over as
adults.

Please!
No more!

POKéMON are only good for making
money. Why not use them
ou stay out of our business!

You’re not saving anyone, kid!

Don’t fight us ROCKETS!

You’re not getting away with this!

MR. FUJI: Heh?
You came to save me
hank you. But, I came here of my
own free will
 came to calm the spirit of
CUBONE’s mother
 think MAROWAK’s spirit has
finally left us
 must thank you for your kind
concern
ollow me to my home, POKéMON
HOUSE, at the foot of this tower.

Can you imagine?
If this volcano were to erupt
he explosion would be the end of
us. How terrifying is that
hile we’re terrified, would you
like me to teach EXPLOSION?

Yeah, you’re right.
It is too terrifying.

You’re terribly brave
hich POKéMON should I teach
EXPLOSION?

Using EXPLOSION while on this
volcano
hat a terrifying thrill!

Over here.
We’ll try digging here
hat treasure the ADMINS’ve been
talking about should be here.

What the…?
You’re in the way. Get lost.

Whew, punched through at last.
Let’s go treasure hunting!

Any treasure we find, we haul back
to the WAREHOUSE, understood
Oh, and what’re the passwords?
At the ROCKET WAREHOUSE, I mean.

What, you forgot the password?
There’re actually two
he first one’s “GOLDEEN need
log.
nd the second one is…

Hey!
This snoop’s been listening in!

You’ve been eavesdropping on us,
haven’t you?

Huh, what?

Why’d you have to win?

Trying to horn in on our treasure?
Don’t bet on it!

Wait!
But how?

Develop amnesia conveniently and
forget everything you heard!

What a setback…
We’ll have to regroup
ou! Don’t even think about taking
a step inside here
f you know what’s good for you,
don’t even think about this!

An active volcano is one that’s
erupting, or about to.

Whew… That was hot!
Sweat’s erupting from me!

They say there’re over 1,500
active volcanoes in the world
ust thinking about them makes me
feel all hot and gooey inside!

Do you know how caves form inside
volcanoes?

Atchah!
You’re shockingly good!

When lava at the surface of magma
hardens, and the magma inside flows
out, caverns are left behind.

I’ve been in training so I can mend
my broken heart
t toughened me up physically at
least! Hi-yah!

I think I tried to overdo it…

The way you battle, it reminds me
of the guy who dumped me…

{RED} found a RUBY!

LOSTELLE: Whimper… Sniff…
Oh! Please, help
 scary POKéMON appeared there
a little while ago
t kept scaring.
It made LOSTELLE scared
’m too scared to move!
But I want to go home…

Oh! Here it comes again!
No! Go away! It’s scaring me
aaaaaaah!
I want my daddy!

Ohh! That was so scary!
Thank you
OSTELLE came to pick some
BERRIES
ou can have this!

What’s your name
OSTELLE’s scared, so can I go
with you to my daddy’s house
kay!
Let’s go home!

Your BERRY POUCH is full.
I guess you don’t want this.

Welcome to the BERRY FORES
e friendly and share BERRIES with
others and POKéMON.

Beware of wild, BERRY-loving
POKéMON!

LORELEI: Keep your filthy hands
off the POKéMON in the cave
o as I say, or you’ll have me to
answer to!

Aww, shut it, lady, and leave
us be
on’t let your glasses get all
steamed up!

LORELEI: {RED}?!
What are you doing here
o, we can catch up later.
Right now, I need your help
elp me kick these poachers out
before they do anything else
hey’ve been catching POKéMON
here, then selling them off
re you ready?
You take that one, please!

W-what?
ho says we can’t do what we want
with the POKéMON we catch?

We didn’t plan on this!

LORELEI: Humph.
So despicably weak
ou!
Tell me
here have you taken the captured
POKéMON
’m smashing your ring once and
for all!

N-no way!
I’m not telling you that!

LORELEI: If you won’t confess,
we’ll deep-freeze you
y LAPRAS is furious for what
you’ve done to its friends
o, LAPRAS!
ICE BEAM…

Wawaah! Okay!
I’ll talk
he POKéMON are in the ROCKET
WAREHOUSE on FIVE ISLAND
here! I said it!
We’ll be going now
But I doubt you’ll ever make it
into the ROCKET WAREHOUSE
eheheheh!

{RED}, thank you.
But this is awful
 was born and raised here on
these islands
 had no idea that those horrible
criminals were loose here…

There are many POKéMON locked
away in the pen…

The pen door is unlocked.
The POKéMON appear to have fled.

Did you come here knowing it’s
TEAM ROCKET’s WAREHOUSE?

What do you think you’re doing?!

TEAM ROCKET broke up?
What planet are you from?

Oh, now your POKéMON look strong.
You’re willing to sell them
h?
You wanted to battle?

Oh, but…
Too much!

We can give you a great price.
Sell us your POKéMON!

I got word about you from the
others
ut there’s no way a kid like you’d
know our BOSS GIOVANNI!

Don’t…you…dare…laugh…

Don’t mess in the doings of adults,
you jumped-up pip-squeak!

I don’t know or care if what I’m
doing is right or wrong
 just put my faith in GIOVANNI
and do as I am told.

I…
I’m shattered…

You’re doing things according to
your beliefs and morals
 understand now…

I’ve made it so you can come back
in through there
hy don’t you go get rested and
refreshed for what lies ahead
he ADMIN after me outranks me
thoroughly as a TRAINER
ou’d better steel yourself for one
harsh challenge.

That’s quite enough of you 
playing the hero, kid
preading lies about how TEAM
ROCKET has disbanded
t’s such an obvious attempt to
cause confusion in our ranks
ortunately, we’re not so ignorant
to fall for the lies of a child
nd now, I’ll show you how scary
an angry adult can be!

Urgh…
You were too strong
Th-that’s GIOVANNI’s BADGE
o it’s true?
TEAM ROCKET really has disbanded?

We will abandon this WAREHOUSE
ut don’t think this is over.
I won’t let this be the end
 will find GIOVANNI.
And I will resurrect TEAM ROCKET!
I will
ntil then, farewell!

A report with graphs and text is on
the PC monitor
The Influence of Magnetic Waves
on POKéMON Evolution”
 … … … … 
t’s too difficult to understand…

I almost managed to sell the
SAPPHIRE for huge money
hen, you just had to come along
and blow the whole deal apart
ufu… Fufufufu…
There’s no forgiveness for you!

Gah! Darn!
Darn! Darn!

If I can’t sell it, it’s worthless!
Go ahead, take it!

What do you want now?
Go on, get lost, leave me be.

What, you again
ou… You’re not GIOVANNI’s kid,
are you
o, that can’t be right!
GIOVANNI’s kid has red hair
ou don’t have any reasons for
bugging me. Leave me alone!

{RED} found a SAPPHIRE!

Fufu… Fufufufu…
I guessed right
 was right in tailing you!

I knew that there was a SAPPHIRE
here, so it belongs to me
’ll sell it to TEAM ROCKET for
serious money
D-don’t glare at me like that
f you want it back, why don’t you
go get it after I sell it
’ll even tell you one of the
passwords to TEAM ROCKET’s
WAREHOUSE
he WAREHOUSE password I know is
“Yes, nah, CHANSEY.
’m done.
Don’t think badly of me!

I’m curious, how do you raise your
POKéMON?

You raise your POKéMON with a
whole lot of love!

In the same way your mother raised
you full of love, you should raise
your POKéMON.

I’m working to preserve the natural
ecology of POKéMON here.

Oh, for someone so young, you are
tremendous!

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t
catch POKéMON
 just want people to raise their
POKéMON responsibly.

I caught a BUG POKéMON that lives
only around here!

Heheh…
Isn’t my POKéMON awesome?

There’s a girl near the BUSH who
measures HERACROSS for TRAINERS.

You know, it just doesn’t feel right
if I don’t use BUG POKéMON.

It’s okay, losing is a fun part of
POKéMON’s appeal, too.

By the way, “appeal” is a weird
word, if you think about it
ike, is it like an orange peel?
Or like a ringing bell?

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Look at all the BUG POKéMON!

I got beat while I was still busy
celebrating!

I’m going to bring my little brother
here next time.

Look, look! There are funny
patterns on the ground.

Super awesome!

The funny patterns on the ground
hey look like the patterns on my
grandpa’s clothes.

I bet you think I’m just some guy,
don’t you, eh?

I bet you think I’m weak,
don’t you, eh?

Ayup, you townies come around all
so dandy with a hat that flashy
ow about giving me that?

Take a deep breath.
Isn’t the air delicious?

If you’d like, I can teach you how
to breathe properly.

First, exhale.
Blow everything out
hen you can’t exhale anymore,
inhale the clean air
sn’t it refreshing?

I love BUG POKéMON.
That’s why I’m here all the time
m I the only girl like that?

I lost, but I’m still laughing.
Am I the only girl like that?

I’m going to keep on collecting
BUG POKéMON
m I the only girl like that?

This is a good spot.
I’ll pitch my tent here.

Wimped out…

I’m going to observe the night sky
here.

Oh, yuck!
I think a bug stung me!

It wasn’t a bug.
I cut my shin on some grass.

A little cut like that…
A little spit’s enough to cure it!

Have you noticed something odd
about these parts?

Have you taken a good look around
your feet?

There are places here in PATTERN
BUSH where grass won’t grow
hat could be the cause of such
a phenomenon?

Hello
elcome to TRAINER TOWER where
TRAINERS gather from all over!

TRAINERS from all over the world
gather here to battle
et me see
ight now, there are TRAINERS only
up to Floor {FD02}.

TRAINERS are awaiting your
challenge up to the eighth floor.

Would you like to challenge the
waiting TRAINERS?

Okay, I’ll get the clock started,
so give it everything you have
n your marks
et set
o!

Please do visit us again!

That was too bad
 think you put in a tremendous
effort in your battling
lease come back and try again!

I hope you give it your best.

When the TRAINERS switch places,
the movement can be hectic
o avoid the stampede, we moved
the reception counter here
’m sorry for the inconvenience.

Hello
 am the owner of this TOWER
ow the sky soars above this
rooftop
he caress of the winds up here
t’s all so perfect
he way you battled…
It, too, was perfection…

This is for you…

Oh!
Stupendous
t’s marvelous how you’ve come up
here so quickly
he fact is, you’ve done it in
record time
’ll have your record posted at
the reception counter.

You seem to have taken your sweet
time getting here…

What I would like to see is a
better time out of you
’m counting on you
ntil then, farewell…

{FD02} min. {FD03}.{FD04} sec.

This is a two-on-two battle
ou may not battle unless you have
at least two POKéMON.

Here at TRAINER TOWER, there is an
event called TIME ATTACK
ou will be timed on how quickly
you can get from the reception
counter to the OWNER on the roof
he best times will be recorded on
the Time Board
ry competing with friends to see
who can beat it the fastest
ou will not earn any EXP. Points
or money by beating TRAINERS here.

Thank you for competing!

I’m here to see how good I am
 wonder what kinds of TRAINERS
are waiting for me
t’s nerve-racking!

Gasp, gasp…
Gasp
ever mind battling! These stairs…
They’re tougher than any battle…

Aiyeeeeeh
 thought this was an ancient ruin.
But it’s teeming with ghosts!

Aiyeeeeeh!
Mercy!

I’m trying to get out of here, but
I always end up at the same spot
aybe the number of boulders is
a hint…

I think there is a mysterious power
at work in this cave.

If you don’t go into the right
tunnel, you won’t get ahead.

Earlier, a lady went into the caves
ahead.

W-what do you intend to do with
me?

Oh… I was afraid that you meant to
harm me.

I am so glad that you happened
here
 grew rather bored of walking,
and I am feeling fatigued
ay I ask you to take me home
from here?

Hey, there!
How’s it going
hat am I doing here, you ask?
Why, I’m prospecting for gold
hen I strike it rich, I’m buying
a house in KANTO.

Hey, there! How’s it going?
Did you hear? I’ve struck gold
ou remembered that I was
prospecting, didn’t you
ou can’t begin to imagine just
how happy I am
o, I’ll show you!
This is for you!

That’s a NUGGET
 can’t give you any nuggets of
wisdom, so that’ll have to do!

Whoops, your BAG is crammed full!
I’ll give this to you later.

A mysterious rumble echoed
somewhere far away.

Hm!
Haaaaaaaaaaah
aaah! This is heavenly!
The water warms me to my core
ou should jump in, too
o to the middle, relax, and get
good and warm!

My favorite part of bathing comes
up right after this
 enjoy a bowl of chowder to
warm me from the inside, too!

The water is perfectly warm.
It feels exquisite
RED} and the POKéMON were
fully refreshed!

Soaking in a hot spring pool is
therapeutic, people say.

Have a look at my face.
See how smooth my skin is
he hot spring’s water keeps my
skin younger than my age.

After an honest day of training,
nothing beats a relaxing soak in
the hot spring pool
RUNO, who’s a senior ahead of me,
visits the SPA on occasion
e comes to rehab injuries, both
his own and his POKéMON’s.

Hot springs go hand-in-hand with
volcanoes
he EMBER SPA here, well,
I made it years ago
 hewed the pool right out of a
gigantic boulder by hand
 was using this at the time.
I suppose I can part with it.

That shatters boulders as if they
were made of crackers.

OAK: Hey! Wait!
Don’t go out!

OAK: It’s unsafe!
Wild POKéMON live in tall grass

VIRIDIAN GYM’s LEADER returned!

You want to know about the two

Oh, okay then!

CATERPIE has no poison,

Oh, Grandpa!
Don’t be so mean

henever you catch a POKéMON,
the POKéDEX automatically updates

You don’t know how to catch

There! Now tell me, that was
educational, was it not

It gave me a headache
ncidentally, are you filling your
POKéDEX
t first, focus on weakening the
POKéMON before trying to catch it.

Well, now, I’ve had my coffee, and
that’s what I need to get going
ut I made it too strong.
It gave me a headache
ncidentally, is my old TEACHY TV
helping you?

Wahaha!
It’s my grandson on the show

though.

If that SLOWBRO wasn’t there, you
could CUT down the small tree
hat way, you could get to the
other side
 think there’s a way around it,
though.

You’re making an encyclopedia on
POKéMON? That sounds amusing.

The people here were robbed
t’s obvious that TEAM ROCKET is
behind this most heinous crime
ven our POLICE FORCE has

Okay! SLOWBRO!
Use SONICBOOM!

Come on, SLOWBRO, pay attention!

SLOWBRO, punch!

No!
You blew it again!

SLOWBRO, WITHDRAW!

No! That’s wrong!
It’s so hard to control POKéMON
our POKéMON’s obedience depends

SLOWBRO took a snooze…

SLOWBRO turned away…

SLOWBRO ignored orders…

selling all sorts of items
lease, visit us in VIRIDIAN CITY
 know, I’ll give you a sample.
Here you go!

Please come see us if you need
POKé BALLS for catching POKéMON.

{RED} put the POTION away in

DIGLETT’S CAVE

Whew… I better take a rest…
Groan
hat tunnel from CERULEAN takes a
lot out of you!

Hey!
I saw you in VIRIDIAN FOREST!

You beat me again!

There are other kinds of POKéMON
than the ones you find in forests.

Hi!
I like shorts
hey’re delightfully comfy and
easy to wear!

I don’t believe it!

Are you using a POKéMON CENTER’s
PC for storing your POKéMON
ach BOX can hold up to
30 POKéMON.

Excuse me!
You looked at me, didn’t you?

You’re mean!

You shouldn’t be staring if you
don’t want to battle!

Are you a TRAINER?
Let’s get with it right away!

If I had new POKéMON, I would’ve
won!

If a POKéMON BOX on the PC gets
full, just switch to another BOX.

That look you gave me…
It’s so intriguing!

Be nice!

You can avoid battles by not
letting TRAINERS see you.

Hey! You’re not wearing shorts!
What’s wrong with you?

Lost!
Lost! Lost!

I always wear shorts, even in
winter. That’s my policy.

I’ll battle you with the POKéMON
I just caught.

Done like dinner!

Trained POKéMON are stronger than
the wild ones.

Eek!
Did you touch me?

That’s it?

ROUTE 4 is at the foot of
MT. MOON.

ROUTE 3
MT. MOON AHEAD

Ouch! I tripped over a rocky
POKéMON, GEODUDE!

I came to MT. MOON in search of
mushroom POKéMON.

After all I did to catch them!

There might not be any more
mushrooms here
 think I got them all.

A punch of roaring ferocity
acked with destructive power
hen the chips are down,
MEGA PUNCH is the ultimate attack!
You agree, yes
ow!
Let me teach it to your POKéMON!

You’ll be back when you understand
the worth of MEGA PUNCH.

Fine!
Which POKéMON will learn it?

Now, we are comrades in the way of
punching
ou should go before you’re seen
by the misguided fool who trains
only his silly kicking over there.

A kick of brutal ferocity
acked with destructive power
hen you get right down to it,
MEGA KICK is the ultimate attack!
Don’t you agree
kay!
I’ll teach it to your POKéMON!

You’ll come crawling back when you
realize the value of MEGA KICK.

All right!
Which POKéMON wants to learn it?

Now, we are soul mates in the way
of kicking
ou should run before you’re seen
by the deluded nitwit who trains
only simple punching over there.

Oh, wow, that’s the BOULDERBADGE!
You got it from BROCK, didn’t you
ROCK is cool. He’s not just tough.
People like and respect him
 want to become a GYM LEADER
like him.

Who’s there?
Quit listening in on us!

I just can’t win!

Whisper…
Whisper…

Excuse me!
This is a private conversation!

Ugh!
I hate losing.

Whisper…
Whisper…

There aren’t many bugs out here.

No!
You’re kidding!

I like bugs, so I’m going back to
VIRIDIAN FOREST.

Huh?
You want to talk to me?

This stinks…
I couldn’t beat your challenge…

I should bring more POKéMON with
me. I’ll feel safer that way.

Me?
Well, okay. I’ll play!

Things just didn’t work…

I want to get stronger.
What’s your secret?

I’ve never seen you around.
Are you good?

You’re too good!

Are my POKéMON weak?
Or, am I just bad?
Which do you think?

You look good at POKéMON, but how
is your chemistry grade?

Ow!
Meltdown!

I am better at school than this!

All right!
Let’s play a game!

Drat!
Came up short!

Things didn’t work today.

You should be informed.
You need strategy to win at this!

It’s not logical!

Go with GRIMER first…and…
…and…then…

I like NIDORAN, so I collect them!

Why?
Why??

When POKéMON grow up, they get
ugly! They shouldn’t evolve.

School is fun, but so are POKéMON.

You made it clear to me that
I should stick with school.

I was planning on getting some
fresh air for a change, but
e’re stuck here because of the
gates at SAFFRON.

MEOWTH is so cute, meow, meow,
meow!

Meeeeyow!

I think PIDGEY and RATTATA are
cute, too!

We must look silly standing here
like this.

Look what you did to my poor, cute
POKéMON!

SAFFRON’s gatekeeper won’t let us
go through
 know he’s doing his job, but I
think he’s mean.

I’m a rambling, gaming dude!

Missed the big chance!

Playing games and POKéMON are like
eating peanuts! I just can’t stop!

What’s a cute, round, and fluffy
POKéMON?

Stop
on’t be so mean to my CLEFAIRY!

I read that CLEFAIRY evolves when
it’s exposed to a MOON STONE
 read that in a POKéMON JOURNAL.
I wonder if it’s true?

ELI: Twin power is fantastic.
Did you know?

ELI: But…
We used our twin power…

ELI: I caught my POKéMON with
ANNE!

ELI: We can’t battle if you don’t
have two POKéMON.

ANNE: We’ll shock you with our twin
power!

ANNE: Our twin power…

ANNE: I’m raising POKéMON with
ELI.

ANNE: Hi, hi! Let’s battle!
But bring two POKéMON.

My bike’s acting up, man.

Aww, man.
I’m not into this.

I got grass caught up in my
spokes, man.

Clear the way, or I’ll run you
down!

You for real, kid?

Don’t think you’re all special and
all just because of this.

You have POKéMON with you!
You’re mine!

You deceived me…

The tunnel coming up is pitch-black
inside
ou’ll need FLASH to get through
there.

Who’s that walking there with those
good-looking POKéMON?

Out like a light!

Keep walking!

I’m taking the ROCK TUNNEL to
go to LAVENDER…

Can’t measure up…

Are you off to ROCK TUNNEL, too?

Don’t you dare patronize me!

No!
You’re too much.

You’re obviously talented.
Good luck to you!

Bwahaha!
Great! I was bored, eh!

Keep it coming, eh
h wait.
I’m out of POKéMON!

You sure had guts standing up to
me there, eh?

Hahaha!
Aren’t you a little toughie!

What’s that?

Hahaha!
Kids should be tough!

I got up early every day to raise
my POKéMON from cocoons!

WHAT
hat a total waste of time!

I have to collect more than bugs
to get stronger…

Hahahaha!
Bring it on!

Hahahaha!
You beat me fair!

Hahahaha!
Us hearty guys always laugh!

Go, my super BUG POKéMON!

My bugs…

If you don’t like BUG POKéMON,
you bug me!

CERULEAN CITY - ROCK TUNNEL

Wow, you came all the way here?
Maybe you’re a POKéMANIAC, too?
Want to see my collection?

Humph.
I’m not angry!

I have more rare POKéMON at home!

Ha-hahah-ah-ha!

Ha-haha!
Not laughing!
Ha-hay fever! Haha-ha-choo!

Haha-ha-choo!
Ha-choo!
Snort! Snivel!

Hi, kid!
Want to see my POKéMON?

Oh, no!
My POKéMON!

I don’t like you.
I don’t like anyone better than me!

I’ve been out at a POKéMON GYM
a few times
But I always lose.

Ohh!
After all my training!

I noticed some POKéMANIACS
prowling around
an you imagine? Them?
Up here in the mountains?

Ah!
This mountain air is delicious!

That cleared my head!

I feel bloated on mountain air!

I’m feeling a bit faint.
I haven’t hiked in some time.

I’m too tired.
I wasn’t up for it.

The POKéMON here in the mountains
are so chunky
 wish there were pink POKéMON
with a floral pattern!

Win, lose, or draw!

Atcha!
Didn’t go my way!

POKéMON is life!
And to live is to play games!

Competition!
I can’t get enough!

I had a chance!

You can’t be a coward in the world
of POKéMON!

Let’s go, but don’t cheat!

Huh?
That’s not right!

I did my best.
I have no regrets.

Careful!
I’m laying down some cables!

That was electric!

Spread the word to save energy!

I just became a TRAINER.
But, I think I can win.

My POKéMON couldn’t win…
Haven’t they grown enough?

What now?
Leave me alone!

Fwahaha!
I have never lost!

My first loss!

You were just lucky, that’s all.

I have never won before…

I saw this coming…

I was unlucky, as always.

I’m the best in my class.
I train every morning.

Darn!
My POKéMON need to be stronger!

There’s a fat POKéMON that comes
down from the mountains
 bet it’d be strong if you can
catch it.

Watch out for live wires!

Whoa!
You spark plug!

Well, better get back to work.

I raised my POKéMON carefully.
They should be ready by now!

Bye-bye!
Thank you, and good-bye!

Tch…
I better go find stronger ones!

DIGLETT’S CAVE

A POKéMON is sprawled out in
a deep and comfortable slumber.

SNORLAX woke up
t attacked in a grumpy rage!

SNORLAX calmed down.
It gave a huge yawn…
And returned to the mountains.

Want to use the POKé FLUTE?

{RED} played the POKé FLUTE.

Yeah!
I got a bite here!

Tch!
Just a small fry…

Hang on!
My line’s snagged!

Be patient.
Fishing is a waiting game.

That one got away!

With a better ROD, I could catch
better POKéMON…

I’m searching for a MOON STONE.
Have you found one?

Oww!

I could have made my POKéMON
evolve with a MOON STONE
 would have won then, I bet.

Electricity is my specialty
 don’t know a thing about POKéMON
of the sea, though.

Unplugged!

Water conducts electricity, so you
should zap sea POKéMON.

The FISHING FOOL versus POKéMON
KID!

Touch too much!

I guess you get to be good at
what you like
ell, you beat me at POKéMON,
but you can’t top me at fishing.

I love fishing, don’t get me wrong
ut it’d be best if I also had more
work.

It’s not easy…

It’s all right.
Losing doesn’t bug me anymore.

What’s catching
ou never know what you could
catch!

Lost it!

What, MAGIKARP
 catch them all the time, sure.
But, boy are they wimpy.

JES: Oh, please, why couldn’t you
let us win?

JES: Oh, GIA, forgive me,
my love!

JES: GIA and I, we’ll be
together forever
e won’t battle unless you have
two POKéMON of your own.

GIA: Hey, JES
f we win, I’ll marry you!

GIA: Oh, but why?

GIA: JES, you silly!
You ruined this!

GIA: I can’t bear to battle
without my JES
on’t you have one more POKéMON?

My bird POKéMON want to battle
with you!

My PIDGEY and PIDGEOTTO combo
lost?

My POKéMON look happy even though
they lost.

I’m told I’m good for a kid.

Ohh!
I lost!

I want to become a good TRAINER.
I’ll train hard, just watch.

Wow!
Your BADGES are too cool!

Not enough!

You got those BADGES from GYM
LEADERS. I know!

My cute POKéMON wish to make your
acquaintance.

Good going!
You totally won!

You have to make POKéMON battle
to toughen them up.

I found CARBOS in a cave once
while I was spelunking.

Oh, too bad!
I just messed up!

CARBOS boosted the SPEED of my
POKéMON.

I’m not going to lose.
Not when the wind’s blowing my way!

The wind turned!

I’m beat.
I guess I’ll FLY home.

Sure, I’ll play with you, sweetie.

Oh!
You little beast!

I wonder which is stronger, male or
female POKéMON?

Do you want to battle some
POKéMON with me?

It’s over already?

I don’t know anything about
POKéMON actually
he ones I use… I picked them
for their looks!

What’re you lookin’ at?

Dang!
Stripped gears!

Get lost!

I always go with bird POKéMON.
I’ve dedicated myself to them.

Out of power!

I wish I could fly like PIDGEY and
PIDGEOTTO…

You need to use TMs to teach good
moves to POKéMON.

Not good enough quite yet.

You have some HMs, right? POKéMON
can’t forget those moves easily.

My bird POKéMON should be ready
for battle.

Not ready yet!

My bird POKéMON need to learn
better moves.

They have TMs on sale at the
CELADON DEPT. STORE
Ms aren’t really rare, but not
many people have HMs.

Aww, bummer!

Try teaching POKéMON a move that’s
the same type as it
hat apparently boosts the power
of the move.

Have you taught your bird POKéMON
how to FLY
ou’ll be able to soar with it into
the sky!

Shot down in flames!

Bird POKéMON are my one true love.
I don’t want to raise anything else.

Have you heard the legend of the
winged mirages?

Why?
Why’d I lose?

Well, the winged mirages are the
legendary bird POKéMON
here are three of them: ARTICUNO,
ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES.

I’m not into it, but okay.
Let’s go!

I knew it!

Winning, losing… It’s insignificant
under this huge sky.

C’mon, c’mon.
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

Arrg!
Lost! Get lost!

What, what, what?
What do you want still?

I need to burn some time.
Shut up and battle.

What?
You!?

Raising POKéMON is a drag, man.

We ride out here because of the
wide-open spaces.

Wipeout!

It’s cool you made your POKéMON so
strong
ight is right!
And you know it!

POKéMON battle?
Cool! Rumble!

Blown away!

You know who’d win, you and me
one-on-one!

KIRI: JAN, let’s try really,
really hard together.

KIRI: Whimper…
We lost, didn’t we?

KIRI: Did we lose because of me?

KIRI: We can battle if you have
two POKéMON.

JAN: KIRI, here we go!
We have to try hard!

JAN: Eeeeh!
No fair!

JAN: KIRI, don’t cry!
We’ll just try harder next time.

JAN: You want to battle?
You don’t have enough POKéMON.

I just got some POKéMON in trades.
Can I try them out on you?

Not good enough!

You can’t change the nickname of
any POKéMON you get in a trade
nly the Original TRAINER can get
the nickname changed.

You look gentle, so I think I can
beat you
’ll give it a go!

No, wrong!

I’m afraid of BIKERS. They look so
ugly and mean!

When I whistle, I can summon bird
POKéMON.

Ow!
That’s tragic!

Maybe I’m not cut out for battles.
I’m not the right type, I guess.

Hmm? My birds are shivering!
You’re good, aren’t you?

Just as I thought!

This is so obvious, you should know
this, but
oves like EARTHQUAKE and FISSURE
have no effect on bird POKéMON.

Oh, you’re a little cutie!
So like a darling POKéMON!

You looked so cute, too!

I forgive you.
I can take it.
I’m a big girl now.

I raise POKéMON for protection
because I live alone.

POKéMON isn’t about winning or
losing for me.

I love having my POKéMON greet me
when I get home
t’s so reassuring.

Hey, kid! C’mon!
I just got these off some loser!

Why not?

Life’s too short.
It’s cool to live as an outlaw.
TEAM ROCKET RULES!

Fork over all your cash when you
lose to me, kid!

That can’t be true!

I was just joking about the money.
Don’t take me all serious.

What’s cool and happening?
Trading POKéMON!

I said trade!

I trade POKéMON with my friends
all the time.

Want to play with my POKéMON?

I was too impatient!

I’ll go train with weaker people.

MYA: Do you want to challenge us?
You’ll need two POKéMON, though.

RON: My sister gets scary when we
lose.

RON: Oh, no, no…
Sis, I’m sorry!

RON: Oh, bleah…
I wish I had a nice sister…

RON: Did you want to battle with
my sister and me
ou need two POKéMON, then.

What do you want?

Don’t you dare laugh!

We like just hanging here.
What’s it to you?

Nice BIKE!
Hand it over!

Knockout!

Forget it, who needs your BIKE!

Come out and play, little mouse!

You little rat!

I hate losing!
Get out of my face!

Hey, you just bumped me!

Kaboom!

We’ll always be hanging around here
even if you don’t like it
ou can detour to VERMILION from
FUCHSIA going along the coast.

I’m feeling hungry and mean!
I need a punching bag!

Bad, bad, bad!

If I’m going to have POKéMON, they
may as well be ferocious
’d use them to leave my enemies
in tatters.

Hey, there!
Let’s have ourselves a good time!

Don’t make me mad!

I get my kicks by harassing people
with my stinking POKéMON
hey’re great for startling people.
And, they bite, too.

You need to focus less on me.

JED: You have just one POKéMON?

I leveled up my POKéMON, but it
won’t evolve. Why?

Why, you!

Maybe some POKéMON need element
STONES to evolve.

I need a little exercise!

Whew!
Good workout!

I’m sure I lost weight there!

Be a rebel!

Aaaargh!

Be ready to fight for your beliefs!

I love swimming!
What about you?

Belly flop!

I can beat even marine POKéMON
at swimming.

What’s beyond the horizon?

Glub!

I see a couple of islands over

I tried diving for POKéMON, but it
was a no-go.

Help!

I guess you have to fish for sea
POKéMON.

I look at the sea to forget all

Ooh!
Traumatic!

I’m looking at the sea to forget
the bad thing that happened!

Oh, I just love your ride!
Can I have it if I win?

Oh! I lost!

It’s still a long way to go to

Shocker!

My boyfriend wanted to swim to

Ahoy, there!
These waters are treacherous!

Ooh!
Dangerous!

M-my legs! They cramped up!
Glub, glub…

I swam here with my friends…
I’m tired…

 hope you’re teaching him all

LIA: I want to battle together

on’t you have two POKéMON?

LUC: My big sis taught me how
to swim and train POKéMON.

LUC: Oh, wow!
Someone tougher than my big sis!

LUC: My big sis is strong and nice.
I think she’s awesome!

LUC: I don’t want to if I can’t
battle you with my big sis
on’t you have two POKéMON?

The water is shallow here.
There are many people swimming.

Splash!

I wish I could ride my POKéMON.
I bet you’re not tired.

SEAFOAM is a quiet getaway.
I’m vacationing here.

Quit it!

There’s a huge cavern underneath
this island.

I love floating with the fishes
here among the waves.

Yowch!

Want to float with me?

Are you on vacation, too?

No mercy at all!

SEAFOAM used to be a single island
in the distant past.

Check out my buff physique!

Wimpy!

I should’ve been buffing up my
POKéMON, not me!

Why are you riding a POKéMON?
Can’t you swim?

Ouch!
Torpedoed!

Riding a POKéMON sure looks fun!

I rode my bird POKéMON here.

Oh, no!
Now what am I to do?

My birds are exhausted.
They can’t FLY me back!

My boyfriend gave me big pearls.

Oh, no!
My pearls were in them!

Will my pearls grow bigger inside
CLOYSTER?

I swam here from CINNABAR ISLAND.
It wasn’t easy, I tell you.

I’m so disappointed!

POKéMON have taken over an
abandoned mansion on CINNABAR
hey call it the POKéMON MANSION
now.

CINNABAR, in the west, has a LAB
for POKéMON
y daddy works there.

Wait!
You’re supposed to wait!

CINNABAR is a volcanic island

Not one good POKéMON to be had!

I got a big haul!
Wanna go for it?

Heheh, MAGIKARP just don’t make
the grade, do they?

I seem to only catch MAGIKARP!

The sea cleanses my body and soul!

Ayah!

The sea is great and all, but I
like the mountains, too.

I caught my POKéMON at sea.

Diver!!

Where’d you catch your POKéMON?

Right now, I’m in a triathlon meet.

Pant…
Pant… Pant…

I’m beat! But, I still have the
bike race and marathon left!

Ahh!
Feel the sun and the wind!

Yow!
I lost!

I’m sunburnt to a crisp!

Hey, don’t scare away the fish!

Sorry! I’m just so frustrated from
not catching anything.

Sheesh, I haven’t caught a thing.
Could this place actually be a
giant pool or something?

Keep me company till I get a hit.

That burned some time.

Oh wait!
I got a bite! Yeah!

LIL: Huh? A battle?
IAN, can’t you do it alone?

LIL: Oh, see?
We lost. Happy now?

LIL: I’m tired.
Can’t we go home already?

LIL: Huh? A battle?
I can’t be bothered to do it alone.
Bring two POKéMON, won’t you?

IAN: My sis doesn’t get enough
exercise, so I made her come.

IAN: Awww, Sis!
Get it together!

IAN: Come on, Sis
ou’re not going to lose weight
like this!

IAN: We want a two-on-two battle.
So can you bring two POKéMON?

{GREEN}: Hey! {RED}
ou’re off to the POKéMON LEAGUE?
Forget about it
ou probably don’t have any
BADGES, do you
he guard won’t let you through
without them
y the way, did your POKéMON get
any stronger?

Awww!
You just lucked out!

I heard the POKéMON LEAGUE is
crawling with tough TRAINERS

past them
ou should quit dawdling and get a
move on!

{GREEN}: What? {RED}!
What a surprise to see you here
o you’re going to the POKéMON
LEAGUE
ou collected all the BADGES, too?
That’s cool
hen I’ll whip you, {RED}, as a
warm-up for the POKéMON LEAGUE

What!

That loosened me up.
I’m ready for the POKéMON LEAGUE
RED}, you need more practice

I’m out of here. Smell ya!

POKéMON LEAGUE

VICTORY ROAD GATE -
POKéMON LEAGUE

Congratulations! You beat our

{RED} received a NUGGET

bridge frightened me.

Okay! I’m No. 5!

Whoa!
Too much!

I did my best. I have no regrets!

I’m No. 4!
Getting tired?

Now it’s serious!

How could I lose?

I did my best. I have no regrets!

People call this the NUGGET
BRIDGE
eat us five TRAINERS and win
a fabulous prize
hink you got what it takes?

Whoo!
Good stuff!

I did my best. I have no regrets!

Local TRAINERS come here to
practice.

You’re decent.

All POKéMON have weaknesses.
Even the strongest ones
hat’s why it’s best to raise
POKéMON of different types.

Dad took me to a great party on
the S.S. ANNE at VERMILION CITY.

I’m not mad!

On the S.S. ANNE, I saw TRAINERS
from around the world.

I’m a cool guy.
I’ve got a girlfriend!

Aww, darn…

Oh, well.
My girlfriend will cheer me up.

Hi!
My boyfriend is cool!

My conditioning isn’t the best…

I wish my boyfriend was as good
as you.

I had this feeling…
I knew I had to battle you!

I knew I’d lose, too!

If your POKéMON gets confused,
switch it out
hat’s a good tactic.

My friend has many cute POKéMON.
I’m so jealous!

I’m not so jealous!

You came from MT. MOON?
May I have a CLEFAIRY?

I just got down from MT. MOON,
but I’ve still got gas in the tank!

You worked hard!

Drat!
A ZUBAT bit me back in that cave.

I’m off to see a POKéMANIAC’s
collection at the cape.

You done got me, and real good,
too!

The POKéMANIAC sure lives up to
his name
is collection includes many rare
species of POKéMON.

You’re going to see BILL?
First, we battle!

You’re something.

The trail below is a shortcut to
CERULEAN CITY.

SEA COTTAGE
BILL lives here!

This cape is a famous date spot
ISTY, the GYM LEADER, has high
hopes about this place.

Hello, are you here alone
f you’re out at CERULEAN’s cape…
Well, it should be as a couple.

The weather’s gorgeous!
Perfect for a battle!

Aiyeeeeh!

Please don’t splash my face!
You’ll ruin the makeup.

I’m beginning to get a sunburn…

Oh, you’re so awful.

I like that cap you have.
Maybe I should wear one, too…

Seen from here, MT. EMBER towers
into the sky.

Well, aren’t you tough?

The sky is immense around these
parts.

I took a break from swimming,
only to have you challenge me?

Hey, what the…
You’re good, you!

Instead of using SURF all the time,
you should swim some.

Wait! Wait a second!
I think I’ve hooked a big one!

I’ve lost it all again…

Not only did I lose, the big one
got away from me, too!

Could you help me out with my
training?

You were a cut above me.

It’s clear that you’re skilled.
I like you!

There isn’t a day in which we don’t
train!

I’m such a fool!

I’ll train even harder from now on!

Every morning, before breakfast,
I swim around this island.

Gasp…
Gasp…

I lost because I’m pooped from all
the running I did…

Dress appropriately for battle!
Lose that frivolous outfit!

Why me?!

Even martial artists are becoming
fashion conscious these days…

You know, everything tastes great
when you’re out in the wild.

Awww, blown!

The water in volcanic regions is
delicious.

My lunch filled us up, so will you
battle us for some exercise?

That made me all sweaty.

What should I do?
I feel famished again.

KIA: My big brother and I make
an awesome combination!

KIA: Huh?!
I can’t believe it!

KIA: How could there be anyone
better than my big brother?

KIA: If you want to battle with
us, you have to bring at least two
POKéMON with you.

MIK: Together with KIA, I’m afraid
of nothing!

MIK: Whoa!
That’s too much!

MIK: How could my combination
with KIA fail?

MIK: Hey, do you want to battle
with us two
ring two or more POKéMON with
you, then.

This is KINDLE ROAD
o straight for MT. EMBER.

Light the Fire in Your Heart!
EMBER SPA

Lying back, rocked by the waves…
It’s exquisite.

I lost…
It feels awful.

The sea is pleasantly warm in these
parts.

Good things get washed up by the
ocean current onto this beach
hat’s why I often come here for
some beachcombing.

The salty tang of the sea…
It tickles my heart.

…Sniff, sniff…
Something smells unpleasant…

Perhaps that reek is your sweaty
POKéMON’s body odor…

Where are you off to in such
a hurry?

You’re raising some wonderful
POKéMON.

If you keep going this way, you’ll
eventually reach BERRY FOREST.

My mommy said that I can’t swim
without my float ring.

Waaah!
Waaah!

This year, I’m going to finally
learn how to swim!

Yay, yay!
POKéMON!

What happens now?

Did I just win?
Or did I lose?

Oh, no, don’t come here!
Please, stay away from me!

Okay, you’ve won!
Now will you please go away?

A POKéMON bit through my 
swimsuit
 can’t get out of the water!

JOY: We’ll teach you what our
favorite POKéMON is!

JOY: Ohh…
MEG!

JOY: Wasn’t that fun?
I hope we can battle again!

JOY: I really want to battle with
MEG
ne POKéMON isn’t enough.

MEG: We’ll show you our favorite
POKéMON.

MEG: Ohh…
JOY!

MEG: JOY, wasn’t that fun?

MEG: I want to battle together
with JOY
ne POKéMON isn’t enough.

BERRY FOREST AHEAD

BOND BRIDGE
Please be quiet when crossing
ERRY FOREST AHEAD

We’re the KANTO RIDER FEDERATION!
Vroom! Vavavavooom! Vroom
y bike’s wimpy, so I have to
make exhaust noises myself!

Hey, hey, lady!
Fork over some spending money!

Aiyeeh
h-who are you?!
I… I’ll call the police!

Those BIKERS…
Are they gone
h, thank goodness!
They certainly had me terrified!

Those BIKERS ran off, and
LOSTELLE was found safe
verything turned out for the best!

With these hands, I will create
my victory!

The shame of this…
I’m red-faced…

Uh-oh, my paint tubes have
scattered everywhere!

Excuse me!
I’m trying to paint.
Please keep out of my sight!

This loss…
I feel like I’m whiting out…

GILLIAN?
Please tilt your head slightly…
There! That’s the look I want!

Hmm…
The angle, it is not quite there…

Oh…
My feelings, they are blue…

The sky and the sea…
They are so fickle
heir changing expressions make
them difficult to capture.

I am visiting my friend’s retreat,
if you must know.

Oh, my, so strong.

I find it pleasurable to leisurely
battle in the gentle sea breeze.

I’m thinking of having a pool
made specially for POKéMON.

Oh, my goodness gracious!

A pool would be nice, but I must
say, a sun-room may be sublime.

I’m a good runner.
I’m really fast!

Oops!
I rushed things!

When I run with the wind, it feels
like I could fly!

I say, this marine life here at
this resort agrees with me.

That’s a shocker!
You must be joking.

Getting so serious over this…
How nonsensical.

SELPHY: Thank you
ou may go now.

SELPHY’S HOUSE

You travel all over the place,
don’t you
ou’re not driving your POKéMON
too harshly, are you
et me take a look.
… … … … … …

Ah, hmm…
I see, I see…

Oh, impressive.
You treat your POKéMON right
 think you can be entrusted with
this
lease, I’d like you to have this.

{RED} received an EGG
from the man!

…Unfortunately, you don’t have
space for this in your party
ou’d better come back for it
another time.

I received that EGG while I was
traveling
’m glad I met someone like you.

Oh, hello.
That’s a cute {FD03}
eeing it reminds me of a sweet 
little girl I met while traveling
he was gently grooming POKéMON…
She was a little angel
hat little girl’s name…
I think it was DAISY.

This is an excellent environment
for raising POKéMON.

Your POKéMON are growing up
admirably well!

You know, I think you have the
talent to be a good BREEDER.

{RED} entered a password

nother password is needed to
open the door…

{RED} entered two passwords
GOLDEEN need log.”
“Yes, nah, CHANSEY.
 … … … … 
he WAREHOUSE’s door opened!

The WAREHOUSE’s door is already
open.

This area’s strictly off-limits!
Out, out!

Is this for real?

You don’t have any business here!
Go home!

There’s nothing past here except
our WAREHOUSE
o what brings you here?

That wasn’t supposed to happen…

You’re wanting to know what’s inside
this WAREHOUSE
t’s better you didn’t know.
For your own sake, I mean.

You’d be wasting time even if you
were to get by me.

Oh, that makes me furious!

You won’t be able to get in without
the passwords anyway.

I’m the eldest of the BIRD
BROTHERS
he best thing about birds…
It has to be the beak.

Oh, so sharp!

You can fly to FOUR ISLAND from
here.

I’m the middle kid of the BIRD
BROTHERS
he best thing about birds…
It has to be the wings.

Flap, flap!

There was a really somber guy
over that way.

I’m the youngest of the BIRD
BROTHERS
he best thing about birds…
It has to be the down.

Down is so comfy…
It makes me drowsy…

It fills me with happiness when
bird POKéMON beg playfully…

Scrub, scrub…

Hello…
Your POKéMON look healthy…

This is where I buried my ONIX…
It was named TECTONIX…

“Here lies TECTONIX” is engraved
on a boulder
here is a LEMONADE placed as an
offering in front of the grave.

Would you like to leave another
LEMONADE as an offering?

{RED} placed a can of LEMONADE
in front of the grave.

Th-thank you
hat was my TECTONIX’s favorite
drink
 don’t even know you, but your
act of kindness
t’s uplifted me a little
an you please take this as my
thanks?

Please be good to your POKéMON,
too.

If you don’t have room for it,
I’ll hold it for you till next time.

Oh, it’s you from that time
 still have that thing I wanted
you to have as my thanks.

Scrub, scrub
 … …
TECTONIX…

Boulders and rocks are neatly piled
up as a cairn
Here lies TECTONIX” is engraved
on a boulder.

There’re no rare POKéMON around
these parts! Not a one
hat burns me up, man.
I’ll take it out on you!

…Huh?

So listen, you haven’t seen any
rare POKéMON, have you?

I’m having no luck at all.
A battle’d be a change of pace!

Nope, no luck at all…

I can’t very well go home without
catching something, though.

Gasp… Gasp
 swam here from SIX ISLE PORT
in one go.

Gasp…
Gasp…

I’m only at the halfway point…
I’m beat…

It’s not so easy sending POKéMON
out while swimming, you know?

I didn’t lose to you at swimming.
This doesn’t bother me.

Are you headed for the island up
past here
 didn’t see anything interesting
there.

AVA: Let’s have a two-on-two
marine battle!

AVA: Oh, you’re amazing!
Even better, you’re on your own!

AVA: You know, I do prefer the
sea over any pool.

AVA: You’re challenging us to
a battle
ou’ll need at least two POKéMON
if you want to do that.

GEB: Big Sister, help!
Please battle with me!

GEB: Wow, Big Sister, this person’s
really good!

GEB: I’m hanging onto my sister
because I can’t touch the bottom.

GEB: Please battle against me and
my sister
Oh, you don’t have two POKéMON?

…Huh
 was envisioning my house, but
this is where I TELEPORT?

Big boo-boo!

I am so scatterbrained
 need to focus so I can TELEPORT
properly to my house!

GREEN PATH
PATTERN BUSH AHEAD

GREEN PATH
Think Green, Keep Nature Clean!

I let a pleasant breeze lead me
all the way here.

Giggle… You’re so cute when you’re
determined.

I want to go to the woods over
there, but
here are lots of BUG POKéMON.
They scare me a little.

I’m practicing in secret so no one
can see me.

Nobody saw me losing, right?

As a performer, I don’t want people
to know about the effort I put in.

What, you’re suggesting that you’re
sick of seeing SWIMMERS like me
ww, don’t be hatin’!

Oh, no, no, no.

I couldn’t lift the stigma of being
a SWIMMER…

My boyfriend’s always busy, so I
come swimming by myself.

Awww, I knew this would happen!

When I can’t be with my boyfriend,
I spend time with the POKéMON he
gave me.

Tell me, where are the mountains
around these parts?

I lost my way while I was busy
battling!

Aren’t there any mountains around
these parts?

MIU: Hello, POKéMON!
It’s time to play!

MIU: Oh, no!
Mommy!

MIU: It makes me all sad inside
when we lose…

MIU: MIA and I are TWINS.
We want to battle together.

MIA: Hello, POKéMON!
It’s time to battle!

MIA: You’re mean!
You’re bad for winning!

MIA: Ohh…
I’m sorry, my POKéMON…

MIA: Oh, you only have one
POKéMON
on’t you feel lonesome?

Wanted!
The Ultimate Horn!

WATER PATH
Leads to RUIN VALLEY

I can’t figure out how I’m supposed
to get inside.

Let me tell you, I found this
place
on’t look so envious, will you?

The door doesn’t budge at all.
Check it more thoroughly?

{RED} left the door alone.

On closer inspection, there are
several dots on the door…

The door is open.

There appear to be many secrets
still unsolved in this world.

Hmm…

I suggest to you that you, too,
give a thought to the secrets and
mysteries of our world once a day.

I’m curious, what compelled you to
come here?

It’s been so long since I battled,
my instincts are off.

There are several ruins on the
SEVII ISLANDS
he majority of them date back
a long way.

It’s been said that there are
mysterious stones on this island
 suspect it has something to do
with the ruins here.

Oh, interesting.

Those ruins over there
 haven’t had any luck in finding
how I can get inside.

A battle with you, so high up!

Oh, the heartbreak of losing so
easily to you!

Experience the joy of climbing!

I’m pretty familiar with the land
around these parts.

You don’t need to be so pushy.
I’ll be happy to tell you.

The door to the ruins…
It has these strange patterns
engraved on the outside
 don’t know what they mean,
though.

I sensed your approach.

Give up…

In your future, I sense that you
will meet many others
 think you will be linked to each
other by a strange power.

Somewhere on this island, peculiar
POKéMON are sleeping.

What an amazing TRAINER!

Somewhere on this island, peculiar
POKéMON are sleeping
ould it be that they’re waiting
for you?

TRAINER TOWER ENTRANCE
Rise to the Challenge, TRAINERS!

TRAINER TOWER AHEAD

Kyahaha!
I’ll flick you away effortlessly!

Tch!
Too strong for me!

What’s that?
I don’t act the way I look
eh, that’s a part of my strategy!

Howdy!
Are you a member of my fan club?

Oh, so you’re not a fan
ell, I can change that.
Let me sing for you!

Lalalah…
My POKéMON, I send them out,
all the girls scream and shout!

This island is too spread out…
It’s not easy patrolling the place.

Uh-huh…

TRAINERS like you from cities,
they sure are tough
ou’ll be headed for the TOWER,
won’t you?

I punish people who abuse
POKéMON!

You don’t seem to be a problem
TRAINER.

If you treat your POKéMON with
kindness, they’ll understand.

EVE: I’ll team up with JON and
battle together.

EVE: Me and JON, we lost.
Ehehe.

EVE: I’m going to work harder with
JON.

EVE: I want to team up with JON
when I battle you
ome back with two POKéMON, okay?

JON: When I’m with EVE, it feels
like we could never lose.

JON: When I’m with EVE,
it doesn’t feel like I’ve lost!

JON: When I’m with EVE, I feel
giddy whether I win or lose
t’s magical!

JON: If it’s with EVE, I’ll be
happy to battle with you
o, I’d like to make it a
two-on-two battle, if I may.

SEVAULT CANYON ENTRANC
RAINERS are asked to refrain from
damaging plants in the CANYON.

My conditioning’s in top form!

Huh?
Something’s not right…

The way I am now, I may have to
hold off on TRAINER TOWER…

It doesn’t matter if you happen to
have the strongest POKéMON
t doesn’t mean a thing if you don’t
know how to use them properly!

You’re a master at this.

You see them every so often,
TRAINERS with awesome POKéMON
who have no idea what to do
efore training POKéMON, TRAINERS
themselves need to grow up.

I work to protect the environment.
In turn, nature protects me!

Whoa! You’re tough!
How about protecting me?

From far out among the stars, our
planet is just a drop of water
ut we want to protect that drop
of water for everyone.

Those shoes you have are pretty
snazzy.

You’re hot stuff in spite of your
cute looks.

Your mom bought those snazzy
RUNNING SHOES for you
he must adore you.

You look strong.
Let me battle you, please!

I knew it!
You’re as tough as I thought!

The way you battle has given me
a lot of useful data
hanks so much!

I was given the best possible
education to become this strong
 don’t want to lose to anyone!

Thank you. I feel like I’ve been
set free by losing to you.

For some reason, I get furious
over the slightest thing
’ll calm myself by breathing
deeply.

LEX: My darling NYA, together
we could win!

LEX: I seem to have been too
careless…

LEX: I think it was a good
experience for NYA
ou have my gratitude.

LEX: May I ask you to battle the
both of us at the same time?

NYA: I’ll do my best so I won’t
drag down my mentor, LEX!

NYA: Oh, no…
I’m so sorry, I…

NYA: I think I’m going to need
much more seasoning and tutoring
under LEX
So, LEX, please, may I stay with
you like this?

NYA: I’m sorry, but may we battle
in two-on-two style?

SEVAULT CANYON
TANOBY RUINS AHEAD

Training by oneself is certainly
not a bad thing
ut it’s also not bad to aim for
the top with a partner
ven BRUNO…
He trained with a fellow by the
name of BRAWLY before.

Do you know anything about this
stone chamber?

That was uncalled for.
You didn’t have to be so rough.

The TANOBY RUINS date back at
least 1,500 years
ut it’s a baffling mystery as to
why it was built in the first place.

A mystic POKéMON is said to sleep
inside here.

I’m not much good in battle.

I hear there are other ruins like
the one here
ight they be the resting places
of other mystic POKéMON?

CLIFFORD is teaching me how to
paint.

We might get in trouble for being
noisy here.

I said that I wanted to paint an
old building
o CLIFFORD brought me here.

Today, in addition to our lesson,
we came to see the chamber.

My, how extraordinary.

Ah, so you are studying POKéMON
on your own
es, you certainly are quite the
extraordinary person, indeed.

MOM: …Right.
All boys leave home someday.
It said so on TV
h, yes. PROF. OAK, next door, was
looking for you.

MOM: …Right.
All girls dream of traveling.
It said so on TV
h, yes. PROF. OAK, next door, was
looking for you.

MOM: {RED}!
You should take a quick rest.

MOM: Oh, good! You and your
POKéMON are looking great.
Take care now!

There’s a movie on TV.
Four boys are walking on railroad
tracks
I better go, too.

There’s a movie on TV.
A girl with her hair in pigtails is
walking up a brick road
I better go, too.

Oops, wrong side…

{RED} played with the NES
Okay!
It’s time to go!

It’s a posted notice
f you’re confused, ask for HELP!
Press the L or R Button!

DAISY: Hi, {RED}
y brother, {GREEN}, is out at
Grandpa’s LAB.

DAISY: {RED}, I heard you had
a battle against {GREEN}
 wish I’d seen that!

Grandpa asked you to run an
errand
ee, that’s lazy of him.
Here, this will help you.

{RED} received a TOWN MAP
from DAISY.

You don’t have space for this in
your BAG.

You can use the TOWN MAP to find
out where you are, or check the
names of places.

DAISY: Just like people, POKéMON
are living things
hen they get tired, please give
them a rest.

It’s a big map of the KANTO region.
Now this would be useful!

The shelves are crammed full of
books on POKéMON.

DAISY: Hi, {RED}!
Good timing
’m about to have some tea.
Would you like to join me
h, but look.
Your POKéMON are a little dirty
ould you like me to groom one?

You don’t need any grooming done?
Okay, we’ll just have tea.

Which one should I groom?

DAISY: Okay, I’ll get it looking
nice in no time.

{FD02} looks dreamily content
AISY: There you go! All done.
See? Doesn’t it look nice
iggle…
It’s such a cute POKéMON.

Oh, sorry. I honestly can’t
groom an EGG.

DAISY: Your POKéMON grow to love
you if you raise them with love
or example, {RED}, may I see
your first POKéMON?

It couldn’t possibly love you
any more than it does now
our POKéMON is happy beyond
words.

It looks very happy
 wish {GREEN} could see this and
learn something from it.

It’s quite friendly with you.
Keep being good to it!

It’s warming up to you.
Trust must be growing between you.

It’s not quite familiar with you
yet
OKéMON are all quite wary when
you first get them.

{RED}, I don’t like the way it
glares at you
ould you try being a little nicer
to it?

…Um, it’s not easy for me to say
this, but
s there some reason why your
POKéMON would hate you so much?

“The lovely and sweet
CLEFAIRY”

{GREEN}: What, it’s only {RED}?
Gramps isn’t around.

{GREEN}: Gramps!
I’m fed up with waiting!

{GREEN}: Hey! Gramps! No fair!
What about me?

{GREEN}: Heh, I don’t need to be
greedy like you. I’m mature
o ahead and choose, {RED}!

{GREEN}: I’ll take this one, then!

{GREEN} received the {FD02}
from PROF. OAK!

{GREEN}: My POKéMON looks a lot
tougher than yours.

{GREEN}: Wait, {RED}!
Let’s check out our POKéMON
ome on, I’ll take you on!

WHAT?
Unbelievable!
I picked the wrong POKéMON!

{GREEN}: Yeah!
Am I great or what?

{GREEN}: Okay! I’ll make my
POKéMON battle to toughen it up
RED}! Gramps!
Smell you later!

{GREEN}: Gramps!

{GREEN}: I almost forgot!
What did you call me for?

{GREEN}: All right, Gramps!
Leave it all to me!

{RED}, I hate to say it, but you
won’t be necessary for this
 know! I’ll borrow a TOWN MAP
from my sis
’ll tell her not to lend you one,
{RED}! Hahaha
on’t bother coming around to
my place after this!

OAK: {GREEN}?
Let me think
h, that’s right, I told you to
come! Just wait
ere, {RED}
here are three POKéMON here
aha
he POKéMON are held inside
these POKé BALLS
hen I was young, I was a serious
POKéMON TRAINER
ut now, in my old age, I have
only these three left
ou can have one.
Go on, choose!

OAK: Be patient, {GREEN}.
You can have one, too!

OAK: Now, {RED}
nside those three POKé BALLS are
POKéMON
hich one will you choose for
yourself?

OAK: Hey!
Don’t go away yet!

Ah! CHARMANDER is your choice.
You should raise it patiently
o, {RED}, you’re claiming the
FIRE POKéMON CHARMANDER?

Hm! SQUIRTLE is your choice.
It’s one worth raising
o, {RED}, you’ve decided on the
WATER POKéMON SQUIRTLE?

I see! BULBASAUR is your choice.
It’s very easy to raise
o, {RED}, you want to go with
the GRASS POKéMON BULBASAUR?

This POKéMON is really quite
energetic!

{RED} received the {FD02}
from PROF. OAK!

OAK: If a wild POKéMON appears,
your POKéMON can battle it
ith it at your side, you should be
able to reach the next town.

OAK: {RED}, raise your young
POKéMON by making it battle
t has to battle for it to grow.

OAK: Oh, {RED}!
How is my old POKéMON
ell, it seems to be growing more
attached to you
ou must be talented as a POKéMON
TRAINER
hat’s that?
You have something for me?

{RED} delivered OAK’S PARCEL.

Ah! 
It’s the custom POKé BALL
 had it on order.
Thank you!

OAK: Oh, right!
I have a request for you two.

On the desk there is my invention,
the POKéDEX
t automatically records data on
POKéMON you’ve seen or caught
t’s a high-tech encyclopedia!

OAK: {RED} and {GREEN}.
Take these with you.

{RED} received the POKéDEX
from PROF. OAK.

OAK: You can’t get detailed data
on POKéMON by just seeing them
ou must catch them to obtain
complete data
o, here are some tools for
catching wild POKéMON.

{RED} received five POKé BALLS.

When a wild POKéMON appears,
it’s fair game
ust throw a POKé BALL at it and
try to catch it
his won’t always work, however
 healthy POKéMON can escape.
You have to be lucky!

To make a complete guide on all
the POKéMON in the world
hat was my dream
ut, I’m too old.
I can’t get the job done
o, I want you two to fulfill my
dream for me
et moving, you two
his is a great undertaking in
POKéMON history!

POKéMON around the world wait for
you, {RED}!

Ah, {RED}!
How is your POKéDEX shaping up
GREEN} has already caught some
POKéMON and added to the data
o, {RED}, let’s have a look at
your POKéDEX
What’s the matter?
You’ve added no new data at all
’ll give you these, so do try a
little harder.

OAK: Come see me sometime
fter all, I want to know how your
POKéDEX is coming along.

It’s like an encyclopedia, but the
pages are blank.

Those are POKé BALLS.
They contain POKéMON!

That’s PROF. OAK’s last POKéMON.

The SAVE option is on the MENU.

PROF. OAK is going to have his own
radio show soon

OAK’s POKéMON SEMINAR.

PROF. OAK may not look like much,
but he’s the authority on POKéMON
any POKéMON TRAINERS hold him in
high regard.

Ah, now this is excellent
RED}, I have another important
favor to ask of you
 need you to listen closely.

Recently, there have been sightings
of many rare POKéMON species
’m talking about POKéMON that
have never been seen in KANTO
 would love to go see things for
myself, but I’m much too old
ince I can’t do it, {RED}, I’d
like you to go in my place.

{GREEN}: Hey, I heard that
ramps, what’s with favoring
{RED} over me all the time
 went and collected more POKéMON,
and faster, too
ou should just let me handle
everything.

OAK: I know, I know.
Of course I need your help, too
ow, I need to see both your
POKéDEXES.

PROF. OAK took both POKéDEX
units.

… … … … … 
 … … … … 
And that’s done
ow these units can record data on
a lot more POKéMON.

{RED}’s POKéDEX was upgraded!

Now, {RED} and {GREEN}
his time, you really must work
towards filling your POKéDEXES
 urge you to make them the best
and the most complete of all time
ruly, this is a monumentally great
undertaking in POKéMON history!

{GREEN}: Gramps, calm down.
Don’t get so excited
’ll get the POKéDEX completed,
don’t you worry about a thing
 think I’ll try looking around
ONE ISLAND first
nyways, I’m outta here!

Coming up with nicknames is fun,
but it’s not so easy to do
lever names are nice, but simple
names are easier to remember.

My daddy loves POKéMON, too.

SPEARY: Tetweet!

SPEAROW
Name: SPEARY

Fwahahaha!
Welcome to my hideout
t shall be so until I can restore
TEAM ROCKET to its former glory
ut, you have found me again.
So be it.
This time, I’m not holding back

GIOVANNI, the greatest TRAINER!{MUSIC:SINISTER}

Ha!
That was a truly intense fight.
You have won
s proof, here is the EARTHBADGE!

Having lost in this fashion, 
I can’t face my followers.
I have betrayed their trust
s of today, TEAM ROCKET is
finished forever
s for myself, I shall dedicate
my life to training again
et us meet again someday!
Farewell!

The EARTHBADGE makes POKéMON of
any level obey without question
t is evidence of your mastery as
a POKéMON TRAINER
ith it, you can challenge the
POKéMON LEAGUE
lso, take this TM
onsider it a gift for your POKéMON
LEAGUE challenge.

{RED} received TM26
from GIOVANNI.

TM26 contains EARTHQUAKE
t is a powerful attack that causes
a massive tremor
 made it when I ran the GYM here,
far too long ago… 

You do not have space for this!

Heh!
You must be running out of steam
by now!

I ran out of gas!

You’ll need power to keep up with
our GYM LEADER.

Rrrroar!
I’m working myself into a rage!

Wargh!

I’m still not worthy!

POKéMON and I, we make wonderful
music together!

You are in perfect harmony!

Do you know the identity of our
GYM LEADER?

Karate is the ultimate form of
martial arts!

Aiyah!

If my POKéMON were as good at
karate as I…

The truly talented win with style.

I lost my grip!

The LEADER will scold me for
losing this way…

I’m the KARATE KING!
Your fate rests with me!

Ayah!

The POKéMON LEAGUE?
You? Don’t get cocky!

Your POKéMON will cower at the
crack of my whip!

Yowch!
Whiplash!

Wait!
I was just careless!

VIRIDIAN GYM was closed for a
long time
ut now, our LEADER is back!

I was beaten?

You can go on to the POKéMON
LEAGUE only by defeating our GYM
LEADER!

Yo!
Champ in the making
ven I don’t know the VIRIDIAN
LEADER’s identity
ut one thing’s certain.
This will be the toughest of all
the GYM LEADERS
lso, I heard that the TRAINERS
here like GROUND-type POKéMON.

Whew! I’m trying to memorize all my
notes.

Okay
e sure to read what’s on the
blackboard carefully!

Let’s check out the notebook
irst page
OKé BALLS are used to catch
POKéMON
p to six POKéMON can be carried
in your party
eople who raise and battle
with POKéMON are called TRAINERS.

Second page
 healthy POKéMON may be hard to
catch, so weaken it first
oison, burn, or cause another
status problem to weaken it.

Third page
OKéMON TRAINERS seek others to
engage in POKéMON battles
o TRAINERS, the taste of victory
is sweet, indeed
attles are constantly waged at
POKéMON GYMS everywhere.

Fourth page
he ultimate goal for all POKéMON
TRAINERS is simple
t is to defeat the top eight
POKéMON GYM LEADERS
o so to earn the right to face
he ELITE FOUR of the POKéMON
LEAGUE!

Turn the page?

GIRL: Hey!
Don’t look at my notes!

The blackboard lists POKéMON
STATUS problems during battles.

Which topic do you want to read?

A POKéMON can’t attack if it’s
asleep
OKéMON will stay asleep even
after battles
se AWAKENING to awaken one
from sleep.

A burn reduces ATTACK power.
It also causes ongoing HP loss
 burn remains after a battle.
Use BURN HEAL to cure a burn.

When poisoned, a POKéMON’s health
steadily drops
oison lingers after battles.
Use an ANTIDOTE to cure poison!

A frozen POKéMON becomes
helplessly immobile
t stays frozen even after the
battle ends
se ICE HEAL to thaw out the
suffering POKéMON.

Paralysis reduces SPEED and may
prevent the POKéMON from moving
aralysis remains after battles.
Use PARLYZ HEAL for treatment.

Hey!
You came from PALLET TOWN?

You know PROF. OAK, right
is order came in.
Can I get you to take it to him?

{RED} received OAK’S PARCEL
from the POKéMON MART clerk.

Okay, thanks! Please say hi to
PROF. OAK for me, too.

This shop does good business in
ANTIDOTES, I’ve heard.

I’ve got to buy some POTIONS
ou never know when your POKéMON
will need quick healing.

Please feel free to use that PC in
the corner
he receptionist told me so.
It’s so kind of her!

There’s a POKéMON CENTER in every
town ahead
hey charge no money, so don’t
be shy about healing POKéMON.

POKéMON CENTERS heal your tired,
hurt, or fainted POKéMON
hey make all POKéMON completely
healthy.

Yes, yes.
It’s ¥50 for a child’s ticket
ould you like to come in?

Come again!

Right, ¥50!
Thank you!

You don’t have enough money.

Please enjoy yourself.

You can’t sneak in the back way!
Nice try, kid, but no
h, whatever!
Do you know what AMBER is?

AMBER contains the genetic matter
of ancient POKéMON
here’s a LAB somewhere trying to
resurrect POKéMON from AMBER.

AMBER is actually sap, that gooey
stuff that oozes from trees
he ancient sap fossilized over
time to become rock-hard AMBER.

I should be grateful for my long
life
ever did I think I would get to
see the bones of a dragon!

Ssh! Listen, I need to share a
secret with someone
 think that this chunk of AMBER
contains POKéMON DNA
t would be a shattering scientific
breakthrough if POKéMON could be
resurrected from it
ut, my colleagues just ignore
what I have to say
o, I have a favor to ask
 want you to get this examined at
a POKéMON LAB somewhere.

{RED} received the OLD AMBER
from the man.

Ssh!
Get the OLD AMBER checked!

You don’t have space for this.

We have two fossils of rare,
prehistoric POKéMON on exhibit.

There is a beautiful piece of
AMBER in a clear gold color.

AERODACTYL Fossil
A primitive and rare POKéMON.

KABUTOPS Fossil
A primitive and rare POKéMON.

The secrets of space…
The mysteries of earth
here are so many things about
which we know so little
ut that should spur us to study
harder, not toss in the towel
he only thing you should toss
ell, how about SEISMIC TOSS?
Should I teach that to a POKéMON?

Is that so?
I’m sure you’ll be back for it.

Which POKéMON wants to learn
SEISMIC TOSS?

I hope you won’t toss in the towel.
Keep it up.

MOON STONE, huh
hat’s so special about it?
Looks like an ordinary rock to me.

July 20, 1969
umankind first set foot on the
moon that day
 bought a color TV just so I
could watch that news.

This month, we’re running a space
exhibit.

I want a PIKACHU!
It’s so cute
 asked my daddy to catch me one!

Yeah, a PIKACHU soon, I promise!

Space Shuttle

A meteorite that fell on MT. MOON.
It is thought to be a MOON STONE.

So, you’re here. I’m BROCK.
I’m PEWTER’s GYM LEADER
y rock-hard willpower is evident
even in my POKéMON
y POKéMON are all rock hard, and
have true-grit determination
hat’s right - my POKéMON are all
the ROCK type
uhaha! You’re going to challenge
me knowing that you’ll lose
hat’s the TRAINER’s honor that
compels you to challenge me
ine, then!
Show me your best!{MUSIC:DRAMATIC}

I took you for granted, and so
I lost
s proof of your victory, I confer
on you this…the official POKéMON
LEAGUE BOULDERBADGE
RED} received the BOULDERBADGE
from BROCK
ust having the BOULDERBADGE makes
your POKéMON more powerful
t also enables the use of the
move FLASH outside of battle
f course, a POKéMON must know the
move FLASH to use it.

Wait!
Take this with you.

{RED} received TM39
from BROCK.

A TM, Technical Machine, contains a
technique for POKéMON
sing a TM teaches the move it
contains to a POKéMON
 TM is good for only one use
o, when you use one, pick the
POKéMON carefully
nyways…
TM39 contains ROCK TOMB
t hurls boulders at the foe and
lowers its SPEED.

There are all kinds of TRAINERS in
this huge world of ours
ou appear to be very gifted as a
POKéMON TRAINER
o let me make a suggestion
o to the GYM in CERULEAN and test
your abilities.

You don’t have room for this.

Stop right there, kid
ou’re ten thousand light-years 
from facing BROCK!

Darn
ight-years isn’t time…
It measures distance!

You’re pretty hot.
…But not as hot as BROCK!

Hiya!
Do you want to dream big
o you dare to dream of becoming
the POKéMON champ
’m no TRAINER, but I can advise
you on how to win
et me take you to the top!

All right!
Let’s get happening!

The first POKéMON out in a match is
at the left of the POKéMON LIST
y changing the order of POKéMON,
you may gain an advantage
ry different orders to suit your
opponent’s party.

It’s a free service!
Let’s get happening!

Just as I thought!
You’re POKéMON champ material!

A shady old guy sucked me into
buying this weird fish POKéMON
t’s totally weak and it cost ¥500!

Good things can happen if you raise
POKéMON diligently
ven the weak ones can surprise
you if you don’t give up on them.

NIDORAN♂: Bowbow!

NIDORAN, sit!

Our POKéMON’s an outsider, so it’s
finicky and hard to handle
n outsider is a POKéMON that you
get in a trade
t grows fast, but it may ignore an
unskilled TRAINER in battle
f only we had some BADGES…

What!
EAM ROCKET is at MT. MOON?
Huh
’m on the phone!
Scram!

JIGGLYPUFF: Puu pupuu!

Yawn
hen JIGGLYPUFF sings, POKéMON get
drowsy
Me, too…
Snore…

I really want a PIKACHU, so I’m
trading my CLEFAIRY for one.

I’m trading POKéMON with that kid
there
 had two PIKACHU, so I figured
I might as well trade one.

POKéMON learn new techniques as
they grow
ut some moves must be taught to
them by people.

A POKéMON becomes easier to 
catch if it has a status problem
leep, poison, burn, or paralysis…
Those are all effective
ut catching POKéMON is never
a sure thing!

Only skilled TRAINERS can collect
POKéMON BADGES
 see you have at least one
hose BADGES have amazing secrets,
did you know?

Now then
hich of the eight BADGES should
I describe?

Come visit me anytime you wish.

The ATTACK stat of all your
POKéMON increases a little bit
t also lets you use the move
FLASH outside of battle.

POKéMON up to Lv. 30 will obey
you
hat includes even outsiders you
obtain in trades
OKéMON of higher levels will
be unruly in battle, however
t also lets you use the move
CUT outside of battle.

The SPEED stat of all your
POKéMON increases a little bit
t also lets you use the move
FLY outside of battle.

POKéMON up to Lv. 50 will obey

POKéMON up to Lv. 70 will obey
you
hat includes even outsiders you

OKéMON of higher levels will
be unruly in battle, however
t also lets you use the move
ROCK SMASH outside of battle.

The SP. ATK and SP. DEF stats of

t also lets you use the move
WATERFALL outside of battle.

All POKéMON will obey you!

Those miserable ROCKETS
ook what they’ve done to my
house
hey stole a TM for teaching
POKéMON how to DIG holes
 was going to use it on a
MANKEY or a SANDSHREW
hat cost me a bundle, it did!

I figure what’s lost is lost
 decided to teach DIGLETT how to
DIG without a TM.

TEAM ROCKET must be trying to DIG
their way into no good!

TEAM ROCKET left a way out!

My husband likes trading POKéMON
ou’re collecting POKéMON for your
POKéDEX, aren’t you
ould you please trade with him?

That BILL
 heard that he’ll do whatever it
takes to get rare POKéMON
e’s not above doing all sorts
of things, I’ve heard.

Have you heard about BILL
veryone calls him a POKéMANIAC
 think people are just jealous of
BILL, though
ho wouldn’t want to boast about
their POKéMON?

BILL has lots of POKéMON!
He collects rare ones, too!

Why don’t you go upstairs and try
trading POKéMON with your friends

ISTY won’t have to be bothered.

You overwhelmed me!

You have to face other TRAINERS

Splash

Let’s do it!

That can’t be!

MISTY is a TRAINER who’s going to
keep improving
he won’t lose to someone like you!

Yo!

et me give you some advice
he LEADER, MISTY, is a pro who
uses WATER-type POKéMON
ou can drain all their water with
GRASS-type POKéMON

A shiny new BICYCLE!

REPEL not only keeps bugs away,

ut your strongest POKéMON at the

That’s odd, MR. FUJI isn’t here.
Where’d he go?

MR. FUJI had been praying alone

This is really MR. FUJI’s house

hat poor CUBONE’s mother
t was killed trying to escape from
TEAM ROCKET.

The ghost of POKéMON TOWER is
gone
omeone must have soothed its
restless spirit!

Hello, hello!
I am the official NAME RATER
ant me to rate the nicknames of
your POKéMON?

Which POKéMON’s nickname should
I critique?

{FD02}, is it?
That is a decent nickname
ut, would you like me to give it
a nicer name
ow about it?

Ah, good. Then, what shall the new
nickname be?

Done! From now on, this POKéMON
shall be known as {FD02}
t is a better name than before!
How fortunate for you!

I see.
Do come visit again.

Done! From now on, this POKéMON
shall be known as {FD02}
t looks no different from before,
and yet, this is vastly superior
ow fortunate for you!

{FD02}, is it?
That is a truly impeccable name
ake good care of {FD02}!

Now, now.
That is merely an EGG!

I’m searching for items that raise
the stats of POKéMON
hey’re effective over the course
of a single battle
 ATTACK, X DEFEND, X SPEED, 
and X SPECIAL are what I’m after
o you know where I can get them?

Did you buy some REVIVES?
They revive any fainted POKéMON!

Sometimes, a TRAINER duo will
challenge you with two POKéMON
at the same time
f that happens, you have to send
out two POKéMON to battle, too.

I’m the FISHING GURU
 simply looove fishing!
I can’t bear to go without
ell me, do you like to fish?

Grand! I like your style.
I think we can be friends
ake this and fish, young friend!

{RED} received an OLD ROD from
the FISHING GURU.

Fishing is a way of life!
It is like the finest poetry
rom the seas to rivers, go out
and land the big one, my friend.

Oh…
That’s so disappointing…

Hello there, {RED}
ow are the fish biting?

Oh, no
 had a nice gift for you, but you
have no room for it!

Even if they are the same level,
POKéMON can have very different
stats and abilities
 POKéMON raised by a TRAINER is
stronger than one in the wild.

My POKéMON was poisoned!
It fainted while we were walking!

It is true that a higher-level
POKéMON will be more powerful
ut, all POKéMON will have weak
points against specific types
o, there appears to be no
universally strong POKéMON.

The urge to battle with someone
you’ve tangled with before
ave you ever had that urge?
I’m sure you have
 wanted to battle certain people
again over and over, too
o, I’ve been giving these away.
Please, take one!

Use that device and you’ll find
TRAINERS looking for a rematch
ou have to charge its battery to
use it, though.

How do you use the VS SEEKER?
There’s nothing to it
se it like beep-beep-beep, and
TRAINERS around you will notice
f any TRAINER wants a rematch,
it will let you know immediately
harge its battery and use it
while you’re on a road.

Won’t you admire my PIKACHU’s
adorable tail?

Humph
y PIKACHU is twice as cute as
that one!

I just adore my SEEL!
It’s so lovable
t squeals, “Kyuuuh,” when I
hug it!

Oh, dear
y SEEL is far more attractive.
By double, I would say.

PIKACHU: Chu! Pikachu!

SEEL: Kyuoo!

I chair the POKéMON Fan Club
 raise more than a hundred
POKéMON
’m very fussy when it comes to
POKéMON! I surely am
o
id you come visit to hear about
my POKéMON?

Good!
Then listen up
y favorite RAPIDASH
t’s…cute…lovely…smart… 
plus…amazing…you think so?…
oh yes…it’s…stunning…
kindly…love it
ug it…when…sleeping…warm
and cuddly…spectacular…
ravishing…
…Oops! Look at the time!
I kept you too long
hanks for hearing me out!
I want you to have this!

{RED} received a BIKE VOUCHER
from the CHAIRMAN.

Take that BIKE VOUCHER to the
BIKE SHOP in CERULEAN CITY
xchange that for a BICYCLE
free of charge
on’t worry, my favorite FEAROW
will FLY me anywhere I need to go
o, I have no need for a BICYCLE
 hope you like cycling!

Oh. Come back when you want to
hear my story!

Hello, {RED}
id you come see me about my
POKéMON again
o?
Too bad!

Make room for this!

Our CHAIRMAN is very vocal about
POKéMON.

Let’s all listen politely to other
TRAINERS!

If someone brags, brag right back!

Our CHAIRMAN really does adore his
POKéMON
ut the person who is most liked by
POKéMON is DAISY, I think.

Hi!
Do you have a {FD02}
ant to trade it for my
{FD03}?

That’s too bad.

…This is no {FD02}
f you get one, please trade it
to me!

Thank you!

How is my old {FD03}
y {FD02} is doing great!

There are wicked people who will
use POKéMON for criminal acts
EAM ROCKET traffics in rare
POKéMON, for example
hey also abandon POKéMON that
they consider unpopular or useless
hat’s the sort of horrid people
they are, TEAM ROCKET.

I think POKéMON can be good or
bad. It depends on the TRAINER.

Hey, kid! What do you think you’re
doing here
ou won’t live long in combat!
Not with your puny power
 tell you, kid, electric POKéMON
saved me during the war
hey zapped my enemies into
paralysis
he same as I’ll do to you!{MUSIC:DRAMATIC}

A little word of advice, kid
lectricity is sure powerful
ut, it’s useless against GROUND-
type POKéMON!

The THUNDERBADGE cranks up your
POKéMON’s SPEED
t also lets your POKéMON FLY
lightning-quick anytime, kid
ou’re special, kid!
Take this!

{RED} received TM34
from LT. SURGE.

TM34 contains SHOCK WAVE
each it to an ELECTRIC POKéMON!

Yo, kid, make room in your BAG!

Now that’s a shocker
ou’re the real deal, kid
ine, then, take the THUNDERBADGE!

When I was in the Army, LT. SURGE
was my strict CO
e was a hard taskmaster.

Stop!
You’re very good!

It’s not easy opening that door
T. SURGE was always famous for
his cautious nature in the Army.

I’m a lightweight, but I’m good
with electricity
hat’s why I joined this GYM.

Fried!

Okay, I’ll talk
T. SURGE said he hid door
switches inside something.

This is no place for kids!
Not even if you’re good!

Wow!
Surprised me!

LT. SURGE installed the traps in
the GYM himself
e set up double locks everywhere.
Let me give you a hint
hen you open the first lock, the
second lock is right next to it.

Yo!
Champ in the making
T. SURGE has a nickname
eople refer to him as the
Lightning American
e’s an expert on electric
POKéMON
IRD/WATER-type POKéMON match
poorly against the ELECTRIC type
eware of paralysis, too
T. SURGE is very cautious
e’s locked himself in, so it won’t
be easy getting to him.

Whew!
That match was electric!

I’m getting my PIDGEY to fly a

Whoops!
Your COIN CASE is full.

You can’t afford the COINS.

Thank you.
Here are your COINS!

Keep this quiet
t’s rumored that this place is run
by TEAM ROCKET.

I think these machines have
different odds.

Kid, do you want to play?

{RED} received 10 COINS
from the man.

You don’t need my COINS!

Wins seem to come and go.
Nothing’s a sure thing.

These slot games…
Win or lose, it’s only by luck.

Hey
ou have better things to do,
champ in the making
ELADON GYM’s LEADER is ERIKA
he is a user of GRASS-type
POKéMON, and at one with nature
he might appear docile because of
her flower arranging
ut she’s not one to be taken
lightly!

They offer rare POKéMON that can
be exchanged for your COINS
ut, I just can’t seem to win!

Games are scary!
It’s so easy to get hooked!

What’s up?
Want some COINS?

{RED} received 20 COINS
from the nice guy.

You have lots of COINS!

Darn! I need more COINS for the
POKéMON I want!

Hey, what? You’re throwing me off!
Here are some COINS, so shoo!

{RED} received 20 COINS
from the man.

You’ve got plenty of your own
COINS!

The trick is to watch the reels
closely.

I’m guarding this poster!
Go away, or else!

Dang!

The TEAM ROCKET HIDEOUT might
be discovered
 better tell BOSS!

Hey

Let’s push it!

A COIN CASE is required…

Oops!
Don’t have the COIN CASE!

Want to play?

OUT OF ORDER
This is broken.

OUT TO LUNCH
This is reserved.

Someone’s keys!
They’ll be back.

I sure do fancy that PORYGON!
But, it’s hard to win at slots!

Gahaha! I raked it in today!
If only every day were like this…

A COIN CASE is required…

We exchange your COINS for prizes.

Which prize would you like?

So, you want the {FD02}?

Okay, a TM of {FD03}
is what you want?

Sorry, you’ll need more COINS
than that.

Hello…
Lovely weather, isn’t it?
It’s so pleasant
Oh, dear…
I must have dozed off. Welcome

I am the LEADER of CELADON GYM

y POKéMON are solely of the
GRASS type
Oh, I’m sorry, I had no idea that
you wished to challenge me
ery well, but I shall not lose.{MUSIC:DRAMATIC}

Oh!
I concede defeat.
You are remarkably strong
 must confer on you the
RAINBOWBADGE.

You are cataloging POKéMON?
I must say I’m impressed
 would never collect POKéMON if
they were unattractive.

The RAINBOWBADGE will make
POKéMON up to Lv. 50 obey
t also allows POKéMON to use
STRENGTH in and out of battle
lease also take this with you.

{RED} received TM19
from ERIKA.

TM19 contains GIGA DRAIN
alf the damage it inflicts is
drained to heal your POKéMON
ouldn’t you agree that it’s a
wonderful move?

You should make room for this.

I should tell you about this GYM
nly real ladies are allowed in
here!

You’re too rough!

Bleaah!
I hope ERIKA wipes you out!

Oh, welcome.
I was getting bored.

My makeup!

GRASS-type POKéMON are tough
against the WATER type
hey also have an edge on ROCK-
and GROUND-type POKéMON.

…Weren’t you peeking in here
earlier?

You’re an eye-opener!

Oh, you were looking at ERIKA…
You weren’t looking at me…

Look, look!
See my POKéMON
 like the GRASS type.
I like how they’re easy to raise.

No!

We only use GRASS-type POKéMON at
our GYM
hy? We also use them for making
flower arrangements!

Oh, hey
e don’t like BUG- or FIRE-type
POKéMON in here!

Oh!
You!

Our LEADER ERIKA might be quiet,
but she’s famous around here.

Pleased to meet you.
My hobby is POKéMON training.

Oh!
Splendid!

I have a blind date coming up.
I have to learn to be polite,
especially if I have to battle.

Welcome to CELADON GYM

Munch

Go ahead! Laugh!
I’m flat-out busted

I always thought I was going to

Hehehe
he slots just reel in the dough,

Don’t touch the poster at the GAME

Welcome to the SAFARI ZONE!

For just ¥500, you can play the
SAFARI GAME
ou can roam the wide-open safari
and catch what you like
ould you like to play?

That’ll be ¥500, please
e only use a special kind of 
POKé BALLS here.

{RED} received 30 SAFARI BALLS
from the attendant.

We’ll call you on the PA when you
run out of time or SAFARI BALLS

Okay.
Please come again!

Oops!
Not enough money!

Are you going to leave the
SAFARI ZONE early?

Please return any SAFARI BALLS
you may have left.

Good luck!

Did you catch your fair share?
Come again!

Hi! Is it your first time here at
the SAFARI ZONE?

The SAFARI ZONE actually has
four zones in it
ach zone has different kinds of
POKéMON, even some rare ones
se the supplied SAFARI BALLS to
catch them
ou can also throw BAIT or ROCKS
besides the SAFARI BALLS
f you throw BAIT, the POKéMON
becomes less likely to flee, but
harder to catch
f you throw ROCKS, the POKéMON
becomes more likely to flee, but
easier to catch
hen you run out of time or SAFARI
BALLS, it’s game over for you!

Sorry, you’re a regular here!

Don’t they have any pennants
promoting the SAFARI ZONE
ow about some paper lanterns?
Aren’t there even any calendars?

Did you try X SPEED?
It speeds up a POKéMON in battle.

We nicknamed the WARDEN
“SLOWPOKE.
ou know, he has that vacant look
like a SLOWPOKE.

WARDEN SLOWPOKE is very
knowledgeable about POKéMON
e even has some fossils of rare,
extinct POKéMON.

WARDEN SLOWPOKE came in, but
I couldn’t understand him
 think he’s got a speech problem!

WARDEN SLOWPOKE is running a
promotion campaign right now
ry to get to the farthest corner
of the SAFARI ZONE
f you can make it, you’ll win a
very convenient prize.

KOGA: Fwahahaha
 mere child like you dares to
challenge me
he very idea makes me shiver
with mirth
ery well, I shall show you true
terror as a ninja master
oison brings steady doom.
Sleep renders foes helpless
espair to the creeping horror of
POISON-type POKéMON!{MUSIC:DRAMATIC}

Humph!
You have proven your worth
ere!
Take the SOULBADGE!

When afflicted by TOXIC, a POKéMON
suffers more and more
t suffers worsening damage as the
battle wears on
t will surely terrorize foes!

Now that you have the SOULBADGE,
the DEFENSE of your POKéMON rises
t also lets you SURF outside of
battle
h!
Take this, too!

{RED} received TM06
from KOGA.

Sealed within that TM06 lies
TOXIC
t is a secret technique dating
back some four hundred years.

Make space for this, child!

Strength isn’t the key for POKéMON.
Do you understand this
OKéMON is about strategy
’ll show you how strategy can
beat brute strength.

What?
Extraordinary!

So, you mix brawn with brains?
Good strategy
hat’s remarkable for a child
TRAINER.

I was a magician once upon a time
ut I dreamt of becoming a ninja,
so I joined this GYM.

I’m done for!

Even though I’ve lost, I will keep
training according to the teachings
of KOGA, my ninja master.

Let’s see you beat my special
techniques!

You had me fooled!

I like poison and sleep techniques,
as they linger after battle!

Stop right there
he famed invisible walls of
FUCHSIA GYM have you frustrated?

Whoa!
You’ve got it!

You impressed me!
Here’s a hint
ook very closely for gaps in the
invisible walls!

I also study the way of the ninja
with Master KOGA
inja have a long history of using
animals!

Awoo!

I still have much to learn.

Master KOGA comes from a long line
of ninjas
hat did you descend from?

You’re more skilled than I’d
thought!

Where there is light, there is
shadow
ight and shadow!
Which do you choose?

Yo!
Champ in the making
UCHSIA GYM is a tricked-up place.
It’s riddled with invisible walls
OGA might appear close, but he’s

Hmm?
You’ve met BILL

BILL files his own POKéMON data on

You can’t become a good TRAINER
with just one strong POKéMON
ut raising many POKéMON evenly
is no easy task, either.

There’s a narrow trail west of

Fishing is a way of life!
It is like the finest poetry
 crummy OLD ROD could only catch
MAGIKARP, yes
ut with a GOOD ROD, you can
catch much better POKéMON.

Oh…
That’s so disappointing…

Hello there, {RED}
ow are the fish biting?

Oh, no
 had a gift for you, but you have
no room for it!

Uh…
Oh, yes, I’m the MOVE DELETER

ould you like me to do that?

Which POKéMON should forget a
move?

Which move should be forgotten?

{FD02} seems to know only one
move…

Hm! {FD02}’s {FD03}?
That move should be forgotten?

It worked to perfection
FD02} has forgotten
{FD03} completely.

Come again if there are other
moves to be forgotten.

What?
No EGG should know any moves.

Hah
 am BLAINE, the red-hot LEADER
of CINNABAR GYM
y fiery POKéMON are all rough
and ready with intense heat
hey incinerate all challengers
ah!
You better have BURN HEAL!{MUSIC:DRAMATIC}

I have burned down to nothing!
Not even ashes remain
ou have earned the VOLCANOBADGE.

FIRE BLAST is the ultimate fire
technique
on’t waste it on WATER POKéMON.

Hah
he VOLCANOBADGE heightens the
SPECIAL stats of your POKéMON
ere, you can have this, too!

{RED} received TM38
from BLAINE.

TM38 contains FIRE BLAST.
Teach it to FIRE-type POKéMON
ULPIX or CHARMELEON would be
ideal for that move.

Make space for this, child!

Do you know how hot POKéMON fire
breath can get?

Yow!
Hot, hot, hot!

Fire, or to be more precise,
combustion
Oxygen in the air…
Blah, blah, blah, blah…

I was a thief, but I went straight
as a TRAINER.

I surrender!

I get this uncontrollable urge to
steal other people’s POKéMON.

I’ve studied POKéMON thoroughly.
You can’t win!

Waah!
My studies were insufficient!

My theories are too complicated
for you to understand.

I like using FIRE-type POKéMON.
I just do.

Too hot to handle!

I wish there were a thief POKéMON.
I’d use that!

I know why BLAINE became a
TRAINER.

Ow!

Our LEADER, BLAINE, became lost
in the mountains but good
ight fell when a fiery bird
POKéMON appeared
ts light allowed BLAINE to find
his way down safely.

I’ve been to many GYMS, but this
one best suits my style.

Yowza!
Too hot!

PONYTA, NINETALES…
Those are popular FIRE POKéMON.

Fire is weak against H2O.

Oh!
Snuffed out!

Water beats fire, of course
ut fire melts ice, so the FIRE
type beats ICE-type POKéMON.

Yo!
Champ in the making
he hotheaded BLAINE is a FIRE
POKéMON pro
ouse his spirits with water
ou’d better take some
BURN HEALS, too.

{RED}!
You beat that firebrand!

Here we go!

CATERPIE evolves into METAPOD?

There are nine certified POKéMON
LEAGUE BADGES?

POLIWAG evolves three times?

Are electric moves effective
against GROUND-type POKéMON?

POKéMON of the same kind and level
are not identical?

TM28 contains TOMBSTONY?

You’re absolutely correct
o on through!

Sorry!
Bad call!

It’s a photo of BLAINE and
MR. FUJI

I found this most remarkable fossil
inside MT. MOON
 think it’s of a rare, prehistoric
POKéMON.

EEVEE can evolve into one of three
kinds of POKéMON.

There’s an e-mail message
 … 
here are three legendary bird
POKéMON
hey are ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and
MOLTRES
heir whereabouts are unknown
e plan to explore the cavern
close to CERULEAN
rom: POKéMON RESEARCH TEAM…

An amber pipe!

Tch-tch-tch!
I’ll teach you a nifty move
each it to a POKéMON, and watch
the fun unfold
t’s a move called METRONOME.
Does it strike your fancy?

I tell you, it’s a lot of fun!

Okay!
Which POKéMON should I teach?

Tch-tch-tch!
That’s the sound of a METRONOME
t tweaks your POKéMON’s brain into
using moves it doesn’t even know.

Hiya
 am important doctor.
Yes, very much so, indeed
ere, I study rare POKéMON fossils.
All the time, I study
ou!
Have you a fossil for me?

No!
Is too bad!

You late.
Where were you
our fossil is back to life!
It was {FD02} like I think!

{RED} received the {FD02}
from the doctor.

Oh!
That is {FD03}, it is
t is fossil of {FD02},
a POKéMON that is already extinct
y Resurrection Machine will make
that POKéMON live again!

So!
You hurry and give me that
RED} handed over the
{FD03} to the weird doctor.

I take a little time!
You go for walk a little while!

Aiyah!
You come again!

I came to visit the CINNABAR GYM,
but the door is locked tight
here should be a key for it
somewhere
ould it be in that burned-out
mansion
he GYM LEADER’s friend used to
live there, they say.

Do you have lots of friends
inking up with the usual friends
is fun, of course
ut how about visiting the
UNION ROOM every so often
ho knows, you may end up making
new friends
 think it would be worth your time
to check the UNION ROOM.

POKéMON can still learn techniques
after canceling evolution
volution can wait until new moves
have been learned.

BILL: Hey, you kept me waiting!
Ready to set sail to ONE ISLAND?

Oh, you’re still not done yet?

Well, that’s it.
Let’s go!

Don’t they have X ATTACK
 like it because it raises the
ATTACK stat in battle.

It never hurts to have extra items.
You never know what might happen.

Yo!
Champ in the making
t the POKéMON LEAGUE, you will
face the ELITE FOUR all in a row
f you lose, you have to start all
over again
his is it!
Go for it!

From here on, you face the
ELITE FOUR one by one
f you win, a door opens to the
next TRAINER. Good luck!

I am so sorry, but you’ve wasted
your time coming here
ORELEI of the ELITE FOUR is
absent, you see
s a result, the POKéMON LEAGUE is
closed for the time being.

AGATHA’s GHOST-type POKéMON are
horrifically terrifying in toughness
 took my FIGHTING-type POKéMON
and raised them to the max
 went at AGATHA feeling pretty
confident, but she whupped us
hat old lady’s also got a really
short fuse, too
t doesn’t take anything to get
that scary lady hollering.

Maybe becoming an ELITE FOUR
member is in the blood
rom what I’ve heard, LANCE has
a cousin who’s a GYM LEADER
somewhere far away.

My daughter is so self-centered.
She has but a few friends.

My daughter likes to mimic people.
It’s rather vexing
er mimicry has earned her the
nickname COPYCAT around here.

CHANSEY: Chaan! Sii!

{RED}: Hi!
Do you like POKéMON
RED}: Uh, no, I just asked you
RED}: Huh?
You’re strange
OPYCAT: Hmm? Quit mimicking?
But, that’s my favorite hobby!

{RED}: Hi.
You must like POKéMON
RED}: No, not me.
I asked you
RED}: Pardon?
You’re weird
OPYCAT: Hmm? Quit mimicking?
But that’s my favorite hobby!

Oh wow!
A POKé DOLL
or me?
Thank you
ou know what?
I can teach the move MIMIC.

Don’t you like MIMIC?

I really love MIMIC!
Who’s going to learn it?

{RED}: Hi!
Thanks for earlier
RED}: Pardon
RED}: Is it that fun to mimic my
every move
OPYCAT: You bet!
It’s a scream!

{RED}: Hi!
Thanks for what you did for us
RED}: Pardon
RED}: Is it really that fun to
copy what I say and do
OPYCAT: You bet!
It’s a scream!

DODUO: Giiih

Expect no mercy

Hwa!
Arrgh! Beaten!

Indeed, I have lost
ut, I beseech you, do not take
our emblem as your trophy
n return, I will give you a prized
FIGHTING POKéMON
hoose whichever one you like!

Grunt!
Stay and train at karate with us!

Hoargh!
Take your shoes off!

I give up!

You wait ’til you see our MASTER!
I’m a small fry compared to him!

I hear you’re good!
Show me!

Judge!
One point!

Our MASTER is a pro fighter.
Be prepared to lose!

Hiyah!
I have no fear for anything tough
 shatter boulders for training
every day!

Yow!
Stubbed fingers!

The only thing that frightens us is
psychic power!

Hwaah
ou’re trespassing in our
FIGHTING DOJO!

Oof!
I give up!

The prime fighters across the land
train here.

You want the hard-kicking
HITMONLEE?

{RED} received the {FD02}
from the KARATE MASTER.

You want the piston-punching
HITMONCHAN?

Better not get greedy…

Enemies on every side!

What goes around comes around.

FIGHTING DOJO

I had a vision of your arrival
 have had psychic powers since
I was a child
t started when a spoon I
carelessly tossed, bent
 dislike battling, but if you wish,
I will show you my powers!{MUSIC:DRAMATIC}

This loss shocks me!
But, a loss is a loss
 admit, I didn’t work hard enough
to win
our victory has earned you the
MARSHBADGE.

Psychic power isn’t something that
only a few people have
veryone has psychic power.
People just don’t realize it.

The MARSHBADGE makes POKéMON up
to Lv. 70 obey you
tronger POKéMON will become wild,
ignoring your orders in battle
ust don’t raise your POKéMON too
much to avoid that problem
ait, please take this TM with you.

{RED} received TM04 from
SABRINA.

TM04 is CALM MIND
t makes the POKéMON concentrate
to raise both SP. ATK and SP. DEF.

Your BAG is full of other items.

SABRINA is far younger than I,
but she has earned my respect.

Not good enough!

In a battle of equals, the one
with the stronger will wins
f you wish to beat SABRINA, focus
and will yourself to victory.

Does our unseen power scare you?

I never foresaw this!

PSYCHIC POKéMON fear only ghosts
and bugs!

POKéMON take on the appearance of
their TRAINERS
our POKéMON must be tough, then!

I knew it!

I have much to learn still
 must master PSYCHIC and teach it
to my POKéMON…

You understand, don’t you
hat power alone isn’t enough to
win in the world of POKéMON?

I don’t believe this!

SABRINA just wiped out the KARATE
MASTER next door.

You and I, our POKéMON shall
battle!

I lost after all!

I knew that this was going to take
place.

SABRINA is young, but she’s also
our highly skilled LEADER
ou won’t reach her easily!

Ow!
Down and out!

There used to be two POKéMON GYMS
in SAFFRON
he FIGHTING DOJO next door lost
its GYM status, though
e simply creamed them when we
decided to have just one GYM.

SAFFRON POKéMON GYM is famous for
training psychics
ou want to see SABRINA, don’t
you? I can tell!

Arrrgh!

That’s right! I used telepathy to
read your mind!

Yo!
Champ in the making
ABRINA’s POKéMON use psychic
power instead of force
IGHTING POKéMON are especially
weak against PSYCHIC POKéMON
hey’ll get destroyed before they
can even aim a punch!

Psychic power, huh
f I had that, I’d make a bundle
at the slots!

Hey!
Don’t look at my letter!

PIDGEY: Kurukkoo!

The COPYCAT is cute!
I’m getting her a POKé DOLL.

I was given a PP UP as a gift
t’s used to increase the PP of
a POKéMON’s move
 should use it on a powerful move
with only a few PP.

MAX REPEL keeps weaker POKéMON
from appearing
AX REPEL stays effective longer
than SUPER REPEL.

REVIVE is costly, but it revives
fainted POKéMON!

POKéMON growth rates differ from
species to species.

SILPH CO. is widely known to all
t’s a victim of its own fame - it
attracted TEAM ROCKET.

Sigh…
Wouldn’t this be great
f the ELITE FOUR came and
stomped TEAM ROCKET?

TEAM ROCKET took off!
We can go out safely again!
That’s great!

…Wait! Don’t say a word
ou wanted this!

{RED} received TM29
from MR. PSYCHIC.

You already know, don’t you?
TM29 is PSYCHIC
t’s an attack that may also lower
the target’s special stats.

Where do you plan to put this?
You’ve no room.

Huh?
You…

Are you maybe…
… 
ou are!
You are {RED}
e were just talking about you
e were talking about how an
incredibly good TRAINER appeared
nd that someone is you!
You’re so cool
o, we decided that we’ll become
your FAN CLUB
e all hope you’ll keep battling
and show us how cool you are
hat way, maybe other people will
become fans just like me.

I’ll always be cheering for you
o, {RED}, go!

I’ll always believe in you,
{RED}
lease show the others what you’re
like when you battle seriously.

I’m sorry.
I was your fan before
ut now, you seem to have lost
the drive you had before
ately, I think {FD02} has been
a lot cooler.

Oh!
{RED}
veryone’s been all excited about
you recently
 can understand why.
I know that you’re strong
ut, do you know what
nce I became {FD02}’s fan,
I can’t just stop being a fan.

I think TRAINERS are so cool when
they’re battling
on’t you think so, too?

Oh! It’s {RED}!
Too cool
h!
Oh, yeah
an you autograph something?
How about my shorts?

However hot it’s been
nd however cold it may get
’ve always believed in, and worn,
shorts
’m counting on you to keep
winning
 believe in you just as much as
I believe in shorts!

BROCK’s my hero!
He’s a man among men
eheh, I got my mom to do
something for me
 got her to embroider “BROCK”
on my shorts!

… 
 …
I’m BROCK’s fan
ven if I were his only fan,
I swear it on my rock-hard will,
and on my shorts
’ll be his fan to the bitter end!

BROCK’s the last word on cool,
end of story
ow there’s a guy who I want to
be like!

{RED}, I’ve had the pleasure of
watching you battle
t brings back sweet memories of
my own long-lost youth
ay you continue to find success.
You have a fan in me!

I have journeyed far and wide
across the lands
ut never have I seen a TRAINER
of your magnificence
ake courage in your abilities
and keep battling on
ake that a promise to me,
my young idol!

Hmm…
And you are
ere you hoping to sign up for
a membership in our FAN CLUB?

Ah, so you are the much-
talked-about {RED}
ou certainly do have the look of
a winner
ut for me to accept you as
a true POKéMON great
 
ou’ve still a ways to go!

All of us gathered here are fans
of POKéMON TRAINERS
he way they look in battle…
They are the picture of coolness
erhaps you will be talked about
here, too, if you keep winning.

It’s {RED}!
It’s {RED}
 want to be like {RED} one day!

Everyone stopped being {RED}’s
fan
ut that means I can have {RED}
all to myself
ay! Go for it!
My one and only {RED}!

Do you know what?
I want to be like SABRINA
 want to be a psychic girl just
like her!

Even if I’m the only one, I won’t
stop being SABRINA’s fan
y dream is to be like SABRINA,
cute, but cool
 want to be a psychic girl just
like her!

I wonder if I can become a cool
TRAINER one day?

Oh, man, oh, man!
Cool! Too cool
Huh?
No, not you
ust the way you battle.
That’s cool.

Yo, {RED}
ooks like I’m the only one left
out of your fans
ut, you know, I like being an only
fan… It’s less stressful
eep up and at it!

{FD02}’s cool, huh?
I love the way he talks
’d really relish a chance to meet
him in person once.

Huh, can you believe it?
Everyone turned into your fans
o after all we’ve been through,
I’m the lone {FD02} fan
h, being the one and only
{FD02} fan’s my style, anyway.

Oh, my goodness!
Is it really you, {RED}
 have to tell you, I adore the
way you battle
 hope you’ll keep at it.
I’ll be your number one fan!

Oh, my goodness!
If it isn’t {RED}
t’s so disappointing… I realized
I’m your number-one-and-only fan
ell, it can’t be helped!
Let me cheer you on, at least
urray, hurray, {RED}!

Recently, {FD02} has been on
fire
he way he battles… It’s just 
the way that I like it!

Oh, hello!
If it isn’t {RED}
ately, all everyone talks about
is you
’m feeling lonesome because I
prefer {FD02}.

Amazing!
{RED}, you really are amazing
nstead of just watching, maybe
I should become a TRAINER, too.

I’m your only fan…
Sigh… This is lonely
an’t you try harder and make the
others take notice of you?

Master {FD02} is so dignified…
He is so my type
hy can’t the others see the
dignity he simply oozes?

I believe in Master {FD02}
with all my heart
ven if I am the only one to
believe in him
 won’t ever feel lonesome, though
ot if I keep thinking about Master
{FD02}.

Hiyah
our battling style is most
educational
 hope that you will keep plugging
away at success, hiyah!

Instead of just watching others
battle, battle yourself
My DOJO’s MASTER chewed me out
like that
ut I won’t let that stop me from
being your fan
 can’t stop being your fan!

Hiyah! There is but one TRAINER
who has my respect
nd that is none other than my
MASTER at the FIGHTING DOJO
ou should become a fan of my
MASTER like me! Hiyah!

Hiyah! I respect my MASTER at the
FIGHTING DOJO
 will never become a fan of
anyone other than my MASTER
 will even sneak out of the DOJO
to spread word of his greatness
iyah!

Are you going to VIRIDIAN FOREST?
It’s a natural maze in there.
Be careful you don’t get lost.

RATTATA may be small, but don’t
underestimate its wicked bite
ave you caught one already?

A fainted POKéMON just has no
energy left to battle
t can still use moves like CUT
outside of battle.

Hi! Remember me?
I’m one of PROF. OAK’s AIDES
f your POKéDEX has complete data
on ten species, I’m supposed to
give you a reward
ROF. OAK entrusted me with
HM05 for you
o, {RED}, let me ask you
ave you gathered data on at least
ten kinds of POKéMON?

Great! You have caught or owned
{FD04} kinds of POKéMON
ongratulations!
Here you go!

{RED} received HM05
from the AIDE.

HM05 contains the hidden move
FLASH
LASH lights up even the darkest
of caves and dungeons.

Once a POKéMON learns FLASH, you
can get through ROCK TUNNEL.

Many POKéMON live only in forests 
and caves
ou need to be persistent and look
everywhere to get different kinds.

Have you noticed the skinny trees
on the roadside
hey can be cut down by a special
POKéMON move, I hear.

Do you know the evolution-cancel
technique
hen a POKéMON is evolving, you
can stop the process
t’s a technique for raising
POKéMON the way they are.

Okay, set six POKé BALLS in my
belt
eah, that’ll do it. At most, you
can have six POKéMON with you.

{RED} paid an outrageous ¥500
and bought the MAGIKARP…

No? You say no? I’m only doing this
as a favor to you!

There’s no more room for any more
POKéMON, it looks like.

You’ll need more money than that!

MAN: Well, I don’t give refunds.
You knew what you were getting!

Sometimes, you’ll have too many
POKéMON with you to add any more
n that case, you should just
store some using any PC.

It’s a newspaper.

I run the DAY-CARE service
ould you like me to raise one of
your POKéMON?

Come again.

Which POKéMON should I raise?

Fine.
Come anytime you like.

Fine, I’ll look after your
{FD02} for a while.

Come see me in a while.

You’re back already
our {FD02} needs to spend
some more time with me.

You owe me ¥{FD03} for the return
of this POKéMON.

Thank you!
Here’s your POKéMON.

{RED} got {FD02} back
from the DAY-CARE MAN.

Oh? You only have one POKéMON
with you.

If you leave me that POKéMON,
what will you battle with?

Your {FD02} has grown a lot.
Yes, quite a lot, I’d say
et me see…
By level, it’s grown by {FD03}
ren’t I great?

You can’t take this POKéMON back
if you’ve got no room for it.

You don’t have enough money.

I’m on guard duty.
Gee, I’m thirsty, though

The types of POKéMON match up
differently with each other
very type is stronger than some
types and weaker than others.

A NUGGET is totally useless.
So I sold it for ¥5000.

I heard that ghosts haunt
LAVENDER TOWN.

Oh… {RED}!
I’ve been looking for you
t’s me, one of the ever-present

f your POKéDEX has complete data
on twenty species, I’m supposed to
give you a reward from PROF. OAK
e entrusted me with this
EVERSTONE
o, {RED}, let me ask you
ave you gathered data on at least
twenty kinds of POKéMON?

Great! You have caught or owned
{FD04} kinds of POKéMON
ongratulations!
Here you go!

{RED} received the EVERSTONE
from the AIDE.

Making POKéMON evolve certainly
can add to the POKéDEX
owever, at times, you may not
want a certain POKéMON to evolve
n that case, give the EVERSTONE
to that POKéMON
t will prevent evolution according
to the PROFESSOR.

Don’t you think it’s hard to think
up good names for POKéMON
specially if you’ve caught a
whole bunch
n LAVENDER TOWN, there’s a man
who rates POKéMON nicknames
e can even help you rename your
POKéMON, too.

If you’re aiming to reach LAVENDER
TOWN, take ROCK TUNNEL
ou can get to ROCK TUNNEL from
CERULEAN CITY.

 big POKéMON is asleep on a road!

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
hat a breathtaking view!

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
o get to LAVENDER TOWN from
CERULEAN CITY
OCK TUNNEL appears to be a good
route to take.

There’s a lookout spot upstairs.
The view is magnificent.

My POKéMON’s ashes are stored in
POKéMON TOWER
ou can have this TM.
I don’t need it anymore…

My POKéMON’s ashes are stored in
POKéMON TOWER
ou can have this TM.
I don’t need it anymore…

{RED} received TM27
from the little girl.

TM27 is a move called RETURN
f you treat your POKéMON good,
it will return your love by working
its hardest in battle.

You don’t have room for this.

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
here’s a man fishing!

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
t’s POKéMON TOWER!

I’m the FISHING GURU’s younger
brother
 simply looove fishing!
I can’t bear to go without
ell me, do you like to fish?

Grand! I like your style.
I think we can be friends
ake this and fish, young friend!

{RED} received a SUPER ROD from
the FISHING GURU’s brother.

Fishing is a way of life!
It is like the finest poetry
rom the seas to rivers, go out
and land the big one, my friend
ow, I have a request
f you catch a big MAGIKARP 
with that ROD, I want to see it
s much as I love to fish, I also
love seeing gigantic MAGIKARP.

Oh…
That’s so disappointing…

Hello there, {RED}!
Have you been fishing
ry fishing with the SUPER ROD in
any body of water
ou’ll find different POKéMON in
different places
h, and don’t forget to bring me
gigantic MAGIKARP.

Oh? {RED}?
Why, if it isn’t a MAGIKARP
llow me to see it, quick!

… … …Whoa!
{FD03} inches
ou have a rare appreciation for
the fine, poetic aspects of fishing
ou must take this.
I insist!

I’ll look forward to seeing greater
records from you!

Huh?
{FD03} inches
his is the same size as the one
I saw before.

Hmm…
This one is {FD03} inches long
t doesn’t measure up to the
{FD04}-inch one you brought before.

Uh… That doesn’t look much like
a MAGIKARP.

Oh, no
 had a gift for you, but you have
no room for it.

The most gigantic MAGIKARP
I have ever witnessed
FD04} inches!

It’s a blank chart of some sort
t has spaces for writing in
records of some kind.

Are you the kid who’s working on
a POKéDEX
ROF. OAK’s AIDE came by here.

Hi! Remember me?
I’m one of PROF. OAK’s AIDES
f your POKéDEX has complete data
on {FD02} species, I’m supposed to
give you a reward
ROF. OAK entrusted me with the
{FD03} for you
o, {RED}, let me ask you
ave you gathered data on at least
{FD02} kinds of POKéMON?

Great! You have caught or owned
{FD04} kinds of POKéMON
ongratulations!
Here you go!

{RED} received the {FD03}
from the AIDE.

EXP. SHARE is an item to be held
by a POKéMON
he POKéMON will receive a share
of the EXP. Points without having
to battle.

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
 large, shining bird is flying
toward the sea.

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
t looks like a small island on
the horizon!

Oh, dear.
You’ve found my secret retreat
lease don’t tell anyone I’m here.
I’ll make it up to you with this!

{RED} received HM02
from the girl.

HM02 is FLY.
It’s a wonderfully convenient move
lease, put it to good use.

You don’t have any room for this.

FEAROW: Kyueen!

No pedestrians are allowed on
CYCLING ROAD!

CYCLING ROAD is a downhill course
by the sea. It’s a great ride.

Excuse me!
Wait up, please!

How’d you get in?
Good effort!

I’m on a relaxing ride on my new
bike with my girlfriend.

We’re going riding together on our
new bikes.

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
t’s the CELADON DEPT. STORE!

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
here’s a long path over water far
away.

Hi! Remember me?
I’m one of PROF. OAK’s AIDES

on 40 species, I’m supposed to
give you a reward
ROF. OAK entrusted me with an
AMULET COIN for you
o, {RED}, let me ask you
ave you gathered data on at least
40 kinds of POKéMON?

Great! You have caught or owned
{FD04} kinds of POKéMON
ongratulations!
Here you go!

{RED} received the AMULET COIN
from the AIDE.

An AMULET COIN is an item to be
held by a POKéMON
f the POKéMON appears in a winning
battle, you will earn more money.

You need a BICYCLE to go out on
CYCLING ROAD!

CYCLING ROAD is all uphill from
here.

Excuse me!

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
ALLET TOWN is in the west.

Let’s see what the binoculars have
to show
here are people swimming.

Hiya! I’m a POKéMON…
…No I’m not
all me BILL!
I’m a true-blue POKéMANIAC
ey!
What’s with that skeptical look
’m not joshing you, pal
 screwed up an experiment and got
combined with a POKéMON
o, how about it?
Help me out here!

Hiya! I’m a POKéMON…
…No I’m not
all me BILL!
I’m a true-blue POKéMANIAC
ey!
What’s with that skeptical look
’m not joshing you, lady
 screwed up an experiment and got
combined with a POKéMON
o, how about it?
Help me out here!

Wait till I get inside the
TELEPORTER
hen I do, go to my PC and run
the Cell Separation System.

No!?
Now don’t be so cold
ome on, you gotta help a guy in
deep, deep trouble
hat do you say, chief?
Please?
Okay?
All right!

No!?
Now don’t be so cold
ome on, you gotta help a guy in
deep, deep trouble
hat do you say, beautiful?
Please?
Okay?
All right!

BILL: Yeehah!
Thanks, bud! I owe you one
o, did you come to see my
POKéMON collection
ou didn’t?
That’s a bummer
’ve got to thank you…
Oh, here, maybe this’ll do.

BILL: Yeehah!
Thanks, lady! I owe you one
o, did you come to see my
POKéMON collection
ou didn’t?
That’s a bummer
’ve got to thank you…
Oh, here, maybe this’ll do.

{RED} received an S.S. TICKET
from BILL.

You’ve got too much stuff!

That cruise ship S.S. ANNE is in
VERMILION CITY
 hear there are lots of TRAINERS
on board, too
hey invited me to their party, but
I can’t stand fancy do’s
hy don’t you go instead of me?
Go on and have a good time.

BILL: Feel like checking out some
of my rare POKéMON on my PC
o on, check out my PC.

TELEPORTER is displayed on the PC
monitor.

{RED} initiated the TELEPORTER’s
Cell Separator.

BILL’s favorite POKéMON list!

Which POKéMON do you want to see?

I may not look like much now,
but when I was younger
 flew everywhere, challenging
TRAINERS wherever I found them
ow, my only source of enjoyment
is reminiscing about the past while
watching battles.

There is a slight breeze blowing
around the box.

Ah!
Welcome, my friend
et me tell you something. There’s
a hidden room in the basement
 TRAINER named {FD02} is
waiting there now
ell me, you did come to challenge
{FD02}, am I right?

Oh…
You won’t battle
 see, I see.
… 
ell, perhaps if you change your
mind, do come back.

Ah!
You will battle for me
t was worth my time moving the
box aside, then
 …
But there is one slight problem
his hidden room is not built very
sturdy
an I get you to limit it to
battles of three POKéMON per side?

Fine! Before your battle, would
you like to save your game?

All right.
Don’t hold anything back!

{FD02}

The match ended up a draw.

A draw, was it
owever, let me say that it was
a worthy spectacle
’d say it was a wonderful battle
with a real sense of depth!

{FD02}

Bravo
ravo, indeed!
What an astounding battle
t was so astounding, why, it keeps
filling my eyes with tears
he thrust and parry of expertly
used techniques
he clash of power upon power
es!
It was sheer magnificence!

{FD02}

Too bad!
I feel your disappointment
owever, that disappointment is
what will make you better
se it, learn from it, and make it
motivate you to seek greatness
orget not this disappointment
and redouble your training!

POKéMON have personalities of their
own, just like people
y PIKACHU has a HASTY nature,
so it grew to be a speedy POKéMON.

Okay, preparations are complete
for me to explore the RUINS.

I need to fish on SEVEN ISLAND
hat will complete my fishing tour
of the SEVII ISLANDS
’d better stock up on some
POKé BALLS first, though.

On this island, different events
occur depending on connections
hat are those connections
hey are for you to discover on
your own.

Did you ride a SEAGALLOP ferry
to get here
here are at least ten of those
high-speed ships
 don’t know where they all go,
though.

If you’re confident, you should
check out TRAINER TOWER.

BILL: Hey, there!
CELIO!

CELIO: BILL!
I can’t believe you came out here.

BILL: Well, absolutely!
How’s your research coming along
Oh, wait a sec.

{RED}, this is my buddy CELIO.
He’s one dedicated PC MANIAC!

CELIO, this is {RED}, a rising
contender as the POKéMON CHAMP!

CELIO, this is {RED}, the
reigning POKéMON CHAMP!

CELIO: That’s really impressive
 hate to say it, but I have zero
aptitude for battling
nyways, I’m glad to meet you.

BILL: So, bring me up to speed.
How’s your machine running?

CELIO: It’s running fine, but we’re
too remote out here
he PCs on this island just can’t
link with your PC, BILL.

BILL: Oh, yeah?
Okay, let me take a look-see
Hang on here…
I think we can make it work.
Let me help you, okay?

{RED}, can I get you to wait for
me just a bit
Actually, can I get you to do
me a favor
he island next to this one’s
called TWO ISLAND
here’s a guy there that runs
a GAME CORNER
e has this thing for rare rocks
and gems
e keep in touch, being fellow
maniacs
o, can I get you to deliver this
METEORITE to him?

{RED} accepted the METEORITE
from BILL.

CELIO: {RED}, if you are going
to TWO ISLAND, please take this.

It’s a PASS for the ferry service
serving the local islands
t will let you travel between the
ISLANDS ONE, TWO, and THREE
h, you should have this, too.

{RED} received an extra page
for the TOWN MAP!

{RED} received
a TOWN MAP!

BILL: I’ll catch you later!
Say hi to the guy for me!

Hmm
ow about we try this like this…

Oh, hey, {RED}
id you see?
We got the PC working
’ve got a few things to show
CELIO here
an you go out on a stroll or
something for a while more?

I’m sorry for taking up so much of
BILL’s time
’m also sorry for being such a 
poor host on your visit here.

The usual PC services aren’t
available…

BILL: Oh, hey!
{RED}!

BILL: What kept you so long?
Been out having a good time
e got it done.
The PCs are up and running!

CELIO: The job went incredibly
quick
ILL is one amazing guy…

BILL: No, no! There was almost
nothing left for me to do
ELIO, I have to hand it to you.
You’ve learned a lot.

CELIO: Oh, really?
Ehehe…

BILL: Well, there you have it.
I’m finished with the job.
We should head back to KANTO
ELIO, I’ll be seeing you again.

CELIO: {RED}, I’m really sorry
that we sent you off alone today
 promise, I will show you around
these islands sometime.

CELIO: Hello!
You look awfully busy as always
ow am I doing
ell, I’m modifying my Network
Machine
hen I get done with the machine,
I hope you’ll be first to use it,
{RED}.

CELIO: {RED}, how have things
been for you
h, is that right?
You’ve caught more POKéMON
o you know what?
Maybe I can be useful to you.

I’m modifying the Network Machine
right now
’m changing it so it can handle
trades over long distances
hen I get finished, you’ll be
trading for exotic POKéMON from
TRAINERS far away.

But, there is a slight catch
or the link to work, the Machine
needs a special gemstone
t’s supposed to be on ONE ISLAND,
but I haven’t found one yet
ho knows where it could be.

I was trying to find the gem
even while I was studying
s a result, I’ve made no headway
in both my search and studies
f I relied on BILL, I’m sure my
research would progress
ut this time, I want to try to do
things by myself.

Oh!
Th-that’s…

{RED} handed the RUBY
to CELIO.

Thank you!
{RED}, you’re simply amazing
 … … … … 
m… May I ask one more giant favor
of you?

It… It’s not anything weird.
Please, I need your help.

While I was studying gemstones,
I discovered something important
here is another gem that forms
a pair with this RUBY
hat other gemstone is supposed to
be in the SEVII ISLANDS
RED}, please, I need you to go
find the other gem
RED}, may I have your ferry
PASS and the TOWN MAP?

{RED} returned the TRI-PASS and
received the RAINBOW PASS.

Obtained an extra page for the
TOWN MAP!

This is my own ferry PASS
t will let you get to all the
SEVII ISLANDS
RED}, please, I can’t do
it without your help.

{RED} handed the SAPPHIRE
to CELIO.

CELIO: So this is the gem that
forms a pair with the RUBY
RED}, you’ve gone through a lot
to get this, didn’t you
ou don’t have to tell me. I know
it wasn’t easy
hank you so much
ow it’s my turn to work for you!
Please give me a little time.

Okay, this is good…

I did it!
I linked up with LANETTE!

{RED}…
{RED}, I did it
’ve managed to link up with
TRAINERS in the HOENN region
inally, the Network Machine is
fully operational
RED}, I owe it all to you
hanks to you, my dream came
true…

I…
I’m not crying
hat’s enough about me
RED}, you’re going to keep
looking for exotic POKéMON, right
 wish you the best of luck!

CELIO: Hello
RED}, I’ve been hearing rumors
about you.

{RED}, what’s your favorite kind
of POKéMON
ILL is a POKéMANIAC, so he loves
every kind
pparently, the first one he caught
was an ABRA.

By the way, {RED}, you’re from
PALLET TOWN, aren’t you
’ve heard that it’s a quiet and
pleasant place
ILL’s hometown is GOLDENROD CITY,
where his folks still live
’ve heard that it’s quite the
festive, bustling city
’d like to go there one day.

{RED}, is there anything that
you can’t stand
pparently, BILL simply can’t
stomach milk at all.

Oh, you’re a stranger here!
Hi! Where did you come from
PALLET TOWN?
I don’t know it!

On this island, there’s an enormous
volcano
t hasn’t erupted lately, so why
not enjoy a hike?

I wish I could trade POKéMON with
my boyfriend who lives far away…

I traded POKéMON with my boyfriend
far away
veryone’s saying that we can
thank you and CELIO
o, thank you!

and HOENN regions.

Obtained the TRI-PASS!

On sunny days, I step out and gaze
upon the volcano
hat’s my daily routine.

Let me think… When was the last
time MT. EMBER erupted?

Young people all want to go off to
big cities
ut I want to stay here forever!

Now, where’s LOSTELLE gotten to
today
he always brings me lunch every
day right about now…

Hm? You, there!
Are you a friend of LOSTELLE’s
ave you seen LOSTELLE around?
I don’t know where she might be.
She should’ve been here long ago
OSTELLE’s a cutie - she got my
looks - so what if someone
hat if something’s happened to
my LOSTELLE?
lease, help me find her!
Please go search THREE ISLAND!

Hah? What is this GAME CORNER?
How much sadder can this get
hose clowns
hey said they’d be waiting on the
island, so where are they
ey, you! Is this the only THREE
ISLAND around here?

Try waking up before you crawl out
of bed, you punk
his is TWO ISLAND
ove it! Get your filthy motorbike
out of my place!

Huh…
Oh, oh, gotcha
ch…
These islands are confusing…

Would you look at that?
That punk scuffed up my floor.

Hey, but listen! I’m begging you,
you have to go to THREE ISLAND
f anything were to happen to my
LOSTELLE
y place is the house with the red
roof on THREE ISLAND
he may just show up late here,
so I can’t run off anywhere
hat’s why I have to get you to do
me this big favor.

I’m sorry.
We’re not running any games today.

We’ll get the games going soon
for you!

So you rescued LOSTELLE?
How can I thank you
OSTELLE, darling, forgive me
addy didn’t know you were scared
and in trouble!

LOSTELLE: It’s okay, Daddy.
I got to be friends with {RED}!

Oh, what’s that?
You’re saying that this is for me
ow did you know that I love rare
rocks and gems
ou sure know how to make a guy
happy.

{RED} handed the METEORITE
to LOSTELLE’s daddy.

Oh, I see, this is from BILL!
You have to thank him for me
ou know, you’ve been fantastic.
I want you to have this.

{RED} received a MOON STONE
from LOSTELLE’s daddy.

Your BAG’s not going to fit another
thing…

All right, I’ll get the GAME CORNER
running right away
ou have to come visit with a
friend.

Listen, listen
lease show me you being cool
again!

I’m the POKéMON MOVE MANIAC
 know every single move that
POKéMON learn growing up
’m also a mushroom maniac
ring me two TINYMUSHROOMS,
or one BIG MUSHROOM
f you do that for me, I’ll teach
a move to one POKéMON.

Sniff, sniff…
Hm! You smell of MUSHROOMS
o you want me to teach a move
to a POKéMON of yours?

Which POKéMON needs tutoring?

Which move should I teach?

Sorry
t doesn’t appear as if I have a
move I can teach that POKéMON.

Then, I’ll need a MUSHROOM or two.
What are you going to give me?

{RED} handed over two
TINYMUSHROOMS in exchange.

{RED} handed over one
BIG MUSHROOM in exchange.

If your POKéMON need to learn a
move, I need a MUSHROOM or two.

Hunh? There isn’t a single move
that I can teach an EGG.

Have you visited the GAME CORNER
already
t’s no good to go alone.
You have to take a friend along.

Not many people live on
TWO ISLAND
here is this old lady who lives
out on the cape
he’s been there since I don’t know
when.

LOSTELLE: Hi, {RED}!
You’re always so cool
’ll make lunch for you, too, one
day, {RED}.

Rare rocks and gems are displayed.

Hey, did you hear the news
he PC network here can now link
with PCs in KANTO
 don’t know how that came about,
but it’s fantastic!

It’s impossible to SURF between the
islands around these parts
he tides are too fast and
treacherous.

Let’s crush BERRIES!
…That’d be wasting BERRIES
ou can always find some BERRIES
on the ground in BERRY FOREST.

Is it true
ELADON DEPT. STORE is several
times bigger than this shop?

I sometimes buy medicine here
ut a lot of people heal POKéMON
with BERRIES from BERRY FOREST
fter all, BERRIES are free and
they never run out.

Those BIKERS were about to trash
this POKéMON MART
m I glad they decided to leave!

Urrrrrrrrgggghhhh…
Kwaaaaah
It’s useless! I can’t make this
spoon bend with my mind
aybe I really don’t have any
psychic powers.

You know about a girl GYM LEADER
in SAFFRON CITY
he uses PSYCHIC-type POKéMON,
right
 admire her, I really do
’ve heard that she’s one cool
customer and beautiful, too.

I bought this house because I
wanted to live somewhere quiet
oday, I think I’ll go out fishing.

You must never, ever go out to
the BERRY FOREST alone
hy?
There are ghosts there.

Papa keeps lying to me, and won’t
let me go out and play!

Me?
I’m not LOSTELLE
he’s probably gone to the
BERRY FOREST, I think
he picks BERRIES there for making
lunch.

I think I’ll go play with LOSTELLE
today.

Ready?
Boing
e’re having a BODY SLAM match
to see who wimps out first
f you were to join us, you’d be
squashed like a bug, though
ow about I teach BODY SLAM to
a POKéMON of yours instead?

Come again!
Boing!

Which POKéMON wants to learn how
to BODY SLAM?

Boioing!

There’s a rare kind of ICE POKéMON
that lives in the cave
e get a lot of visitors hoping to
see that POKéMON.

Oh? A POKéMON EGG?
…I have no idea
Oh, wait. The DAY-CARE people
in town were saying something
hey said that they’d found EGGS
before on their property.

What’s this
he new POKéMON JOURNAL hasn’t
arrived on this island?

There! Boing!
You’re awfully heavy!

LORELEI: There’s something weighing
heavily on my mind
f anything were to happen on
the island where I was born
 wouldn’t know about it if I were
in the POKéMON LEAGUE
 wonder if that would make me
irresponsible to my home…

LORELEI: So, you managed to solve
all the problems here
hat’s wonderful
hat means there isn’t any reason
for me to be here all the time
hank you
’ll return to the POKéMON LEAGUE
in a short while.

I don’t know what will happen in
the future, but
 will do what I can here and now.
That’s all I can do.

Stuffed POKéMON dolls galore!

We’ve had a great and powerful
TRAINER grow up on this island
 bet even you’d know her.
It’s LORELEI of the ELITE FOUR
hen LORELEI was just a tyke,
I taught her about POKéMON.

The SEVII ISLANDS are in a warm
region overall
ut there is one exception you
need to know about
he ICEFALL CAVE is frigid because
of the POKéMON that live in it.

I’m on my way to prepare a meal
for a certain high-society person.

You’re on a quest to catch every
single kind of POKéMON
How incredible. Please tell me if
you catch a strong one!

Don’t worry about buying anything
for dinner tonight
That’s what my husband said when
he went off fishing today
’m not sure if I can count on him
to live up to that promise.

That MEADOW has belonged to our
family for generations
 should have had a giant mansion
built on it
t would be preferable to having
those thugs run wild on it!

For ten years, I’ve searched for
RUINS
o, make that twenty years
 get this feeling that there’s
something hidden on this island.

You know of POKéMON that evolve
only upon trading, yes
ut did you know that there are
still others
ome POKéMON evolve only when
traded while holding specific items.

{GREEN}: Hey, {RED}!
How’s your POKéDEX filling up
t looks like it’s impossible to get
all the POKéMON by hanging around
just these parts
aybe there are POKéMON we don’t
know about somewhere far away
 … … … … … … … 
ell, if I can’t do it, there’s no
way for you to get it done
’m not going to get all desperate
over this
’ll keep collecting POKéMON at my
own pace while I train them
hat’s what I’ll do.
So there’s no point staying here.
I may as well leave for home
hat’s that, then!
Smell ya later!

There’s nothing that young people’d
find exciting here on this island
ut, this is a good place in terms
of nature and history
elax and enjoy your stay.

Play with POKéMON lots and live
a long life
ake AGATHA, for example
he set a record for being the
oldest-ever ELITE FOUR member
he spurs me to do bigger things.

I should buy some MAIL and write
him a letter…

SELPHY: Oh?
Do I know you from somewhere
h, but that doesn’t matter
 am exquisitely bored.
Please, hear my wish.

I wish to see a POKéMON.
A darling {FD02}
 want to see one right away.
Please, make my wish come true.

SELPHY: Oh, I’m tired of this.
I’m tired of waiting for you
’ll forgive you this time, but
please don’t fail me next time.

SELPHY: Oh, hello, there
h, my gracious. That must be the
{FD02} you caught for me
iggle…
I see a resemblance to you
hank you so kindly
 … … … … …
Is something the matter
ou may leave
 … … … … …
Oh, fine. I understand now
EBASTIAN!
I need you here this instant!

Butler: Yes, my lady.

SELPHY: See to it that this person
is given a token of appreciation.

Butler: I shall do as you bid,
my lady.

Butler: I sincerely thank you for
pleasing Lady SELPHY
lease accept this as her thanks…

Butler: Your BAG appears to be
unfortunately full.

Oh…
How disappointing.

SELPHY: I wish you the best of
luck.

Butler: The smile of Lady SELPHY
has the brilliance of the sun
lease, I beg you to bring joy
to Lady SELPHY.

I perfected the ultimate move of
its type
ut will no one take it for
future use
Hm? Hmmm
-you…
Th-that {FD02}…

…No…
I was just mistaken.

Oh! This is the one!
This is the POKéMON
his {FD02} is worthy of
learning my ultimate move
ill you allow it
ill you allow your {FD02} to
learn my {FD03}?

Gaah! You reject it?
No, I won’t be dissuaded!

You will allow it
hen, let me confer my ultimate
{FD03} on your {FD02}
gggrah-awooo!

Gasp, gasp, gasp
 didn’t think I could teach that

What is a GYM?

You become the main character,
exploring the world of POKéMON.
By talking to people and solving
mysteries, new paths will open to you.
Strive for the goal together with your
wonderful POKéMON.

When you come across another person,
go up to them and press the A Button.
That will get them to talk and interact
with your character. You may also
examine various items and objects in
the same way. Talk to people and check
things often to obtain information.

On the stairs or the exits of a
building is a red mat. Move your
character to stand on top of the
red mat. Press the + Control Pad 
toward the stairs or the exit to
advance.

This isn’t something you should worry
about too much.
Talk to other people, check signs,
check things, and so on.
Sometimes, you may need to just move
to a new town or place.

Try moving on to a new road, town, or
place.

There could be something in the town
or inside a building that is the cause.
Try talking to the people in the area
again. If there is a problem that they
need solved, you may have to help.
Afterwards, try talking to the person
blocking your way again.

Try talking to people by going up to
them and pressing the A Button.
Also, try checking things like odd trees
and strange rocks with the A Button.
Press the + Control Pad and try going
to places that look impassable, too.

Try going to places where you 
haven’t visited yet.
Also, check everything that looks
suspicious by pressing the A Button.

Any item that you are given by another
character goes in your BAG.
The item is automatically sorted and
placed in one of three pockets.
For instructions on the BAG’s use,
please refer to the HELP System’s
“How do I do this?” heading.

If POKéMON are hurt in battle,
take them to a POKéMON CENTER and
have them healed by the staff.
Get in the habit of saving your
game and recording your progress.
Stock up on healing items at
POKéMON MARTS before traveling far.

Forests are basically the same as
roads but they can be like mazes.
All forests have a way out, so don’t
give up if you get lost.

Caves are dark and dangerous. Wild
POKéMON can appear anywhere in them.
If there is an emergency, rush to a
POKéMON CENTER or use items.
New towns await discovery beyond some
caves, so don’t give up.

The object of the game is to train
your POKéMON and move forward.
You must collect info and solve
problems. For example, what do you
need to get around an obstacle?
What would get that impeding
person out of the way?

There are several kinds of items.
Some can be used only on the field.
Some are only for use during battle.
Some can be used anytime.
Try using an item - if it can’t be used,
you will be alerted.

In a battle, POKéMON try to reduce
one another’s vitality, expressed as
HP. If a POKéMON’s HP falls to zero,
it faints, and the other POKéMON
wins. By winning a battle, POKéMON
earn EXP. Points, which help them
level up (grow stronger).

First, fully heal the POKéMON in your
party (the POKéMON with you) at any
POKéMON CENTER.
You should also buy healing items for
emergencies at a POKéMON MART.

A POKéMON’s vitality is expressed in HP.
If a POKéMON is hurt in battle, HP is
subtracted. If its HP drops to zero,
the POKéMON faints.
Heal hurt or fainted POKéMON at a
POKéMON CENTER or by using items.

A POKéMON CENTER is like an inn for
POKéMON. It will fully heal POKéMON of
any status problems and fully restore
their HP using a special machine.
This service is free, so get in the
habit of healing your POKéMON often.

A status problem refers to an ailment
that is inflicted on a POKéMON by its
foe’s attack. These include burns,
paralysis, poisoning, sleep, and
freezing. These can be healed by
visiting a POKéMON CENTER or using
the appropriate item.

If all the POKéMON in your party
(all the POKéMON with you) faint, you
lose some MONEY, and you are
returned home or to a POKéMON
CENTER. To reduce that chance, visit
POKéMON CENTERS often. Also, get
in the habit of saving often.

If a wild POKéMON escapes from a POKé
BALL, it’s obviously still feisty.
Try reducing its HP some more, and
try to weaken it with paralysis or sleep
before trying to catch it.
If the POKé BALL rocks for a while,
the quarry is close to being caught!

There are shops, known as POKéMON
MARTS, that sell items.
You will not find POKéMON MARTS on
roads, in forests, or in caves.
Stock up on needed items while you are
visiting a town with a POKéMON MART.

You may buy POKé BALLS at any
POKéMON MART in any town.
You will not find POKéMON MARTS on
roads, in forests, or in caves.
Stock up on POKé BALLS while you are
visiting a town with a POKéMON MART.

A TRAINER is a person who raises
POKéMON through battling.
TRAINERS will challenge you 
wherever they are - it could be on
a road, in forests, caves, anywhere.
If your eyes meet, you have to accept
their challenge. So be careful!

To beat a TRAINER in battle, use
POKéMON that have type advantages
over the foe’s POKéMON. You may also
use highly trained POKéMON with
overwhelming power. Outnumbering the
foe’s POKéMON is another obvious
tactic.

Wild POKéMON will appear in tall grass,
on roads, and in forests. They will
appear anywhere in dark caves.
There are no wild POKéMON or TRAINERS
in towns, so they are safe places.

POKéMON may learn up to four different
techniques, or moves. There is a great
variety of moves including attacks and
those with special effects. The kinds
of moves that can be learned vary
for each POKéMON. Some moves
can be learned from machines.

HIDDEN moves are those that are
especially important for your
adventure. To use such a move outside
of battle, open the “POKéMON” MENU
and make the POKéMON that knows the
move use it. A fainted POKéMON may use
a HIDDEN move outside of battle.

Select “FIGHT,” and the MENU of moves
will appear. Consider the type
matchups, and use the most effective
moves. You can check the effects of
moves by opening “POKéMON,”
picking a POKéMON, opening “SUMMARY,”
then opening “POKéMON SKILLS.”

The most a POKéMON can learn is four
moves. They are learned as the
POKéMON levels up. It can also be
taught a move using a TM (Technical
Machine) or HM (Hidden Machine).
There are also people who teach moves.

The key to making your POKéMON
strong is to battle and win often.
The EXP. (Experience) Points earned
by winning battles accumulate to
level up POKéMON that participated in
them. Battle wild POKéMON often to
level up your party.

If your foes are too strong, try
leveling up your POKéMON some more.
Go back the way you came and battle
wild POKéMON to level up your party.
You may also battle TRAINERS whom you
have not battled before.

Unlike roads and forests, wild POKéMON
can appear anywhere in caves.
If your POKéMON are hurt in a cave,
rush to a POKéMON CENTER or use items
to heal them right away. It is very
dangerous to force your luck in caves.

Trust your own knowledge and power.
Believe in yourself and find your way!

A POKéMON CENTER is identified by its
red roof and a “P.C” sign. Every
POKéMON CENTER offers such services as
fully healing POKéMON and free PC use,
making it essential for your travels.
On the upper floor are facilities for
linking with friends and others.

A POKéMON MART is identified by its
blue roof and a “MART” sign.
Items can be bought and sold at any
POKéMON MART. Some MARTS carry items
that are available only in their towns.

You can safely end your game by
selecting “SAVE” on the MENU.
Once you have saved, the game can be
safely turned off. When the game is
turned back on, you can resume from
where you last saved.

POKéMON are living beings about which
many mysteries still remain. You may
see them in grass, the sea, and caves.
They appear to obey the wishes of the
TRAINERS that caught them.

Use the FAME CHECKER among the
KEY ITEMS in your BAG.
It may give you a hint, so try it out.

A HIDDEN move is taught to a POKéMON
using an HM (Hidden Machine).
A HIDDEN move is important for helping
your adventure. For example, one is
used to light up dark caves. Another
cuts down small trees. There is one
for traveling on water, and so on.

Try to catch wild POKéMON by throwing
the special SAFARI BALLS.
You may keep any item you find, too.

Your SAFARI GAME ends once you have
traveled a certain distance or thrown
all your SAFARI BALLS.
Open the MENU to check the remaining
number of steps and SAFARI BALLS.

If you would like to cut your SAFARI
GAME short, open the MENU and select
“RETIRE” at the top of the list.

POKéMON GYMS are operated by the
POKéMON LEAGUE and are training
facilities for TRAINERS. They are all
across the land in cities and towns.
Each one is headed by a LEADER, who
is a very skilled TRAINER. Beat the
LEADER to collect a BADGE.

HP indicates a POKéMON’s vitality.
If a POKéMON’s HP drops to zero, it
faints and is unable to battle.
So, the key in battle is to try to
reduce the foe’s HP to zero.
If your POKéMON are hurt, restore their
HP at a POKéMON CENTER or use items.

EXP. Points stands for “Experience
Points.” POKéMON gain EXP. Points by
participating in winning battles.
When a POKéMON accumulates sufficient
EXP. Points, it levels up. The EXP. Bar
indicates accumulated EXP. Points.
It returns to zero upon leveling up.

POKéMON may learn up to four different
moves. There are many kinds of moves
including attacks and those with
special effects. The kinds of moves
that can be learned vary for each
POKéMON. Some moves can be learned
from items.

ATTACK indicates the power of an
offensive move. The higher this stat,
the more powerful the move.
It is applied for the following move
types: NORMAL, POISON, GROUND,
FLYING, BUG, FIGHTING, ROCK, GHOST,
and STEEL.

DEFENSE indicates the resistance a
POKéMON has against physical attacks.
The higher this stat, the less damage
sustained from a foe’s physical hit.

SP. ATK (Special Attack) indicates the
power of a special attack move.
The higher this stat, the more powerful
the special attack move.
It is applied for the following move
types: FIRE, WATER, ELECTRIC, GRASS,
ICE, PSYCHIC, DRAGON, and DARK.

SP. DEF (Special Defense) indicates
the resistance a POKéMON has against
special attacks.
The higher this stat, the less damage
sustained from a foe’s special attack.

SPEED indicates the agility of a
POKéMON. If this stat exceeds the foe’s
in battle, the POKéMON can make a move
before its slower opponent.

Lv. (Level) indicates the growth and
strength of a POKéMON.
In general, when a POKéMON levels up,
its stats such as HP, ATTACK, and
DEFENSE rise, making it stronger.
POKéMON may learn a new move upon
leveling up.

POKéMON and moves are classified by
type. Every type has advantageous and
disadvantageous matchups against
other types. For example, like a rock-
paper-scissors game, the WATER type is
strong against the FIRE type and weak
against the GRASS type.

OT stands for “Original TRAINER,”
the first TRAINER to have caught the
selected POKéMON.
Even if the POKéMON is traded, the OT
name will remain unchanged.

All POKéMON can be made to hold one
item each. Some items will be used by
the POKéMON automatically in certain
situations. To make a POKéMON hold an
item, select the item from the BAG and
“GIVE” it to the POKéMON.

All POKéMON have a special ABILITY.
There are many different kinds of these
abilities, some used in battle, some
elsewhere. The abilities differ from
species to species. Some species may
have more than one kind of ability.

Whenever you win a battle against a
TRAINER, you are given prize money.
Save up your prize money so you can
enjoy shopping at POKéMON MARTS!

Moves are also classified by types.
If a POKéMON of a certain type uses
a move of the same type, the move’s
power is boosted. If the move’s type
has a matchup advantage against the
target, its effectiveness is also
boosted.

All POKéMON have a personality,
or “NATURE.” The POKéMON’s
nature appears to affect how the
POKéMON will grow upon leveling up.

The ID No. is a special number assigned
specifically to you as a TRAINER.
Together with the OT name, the ID No.
is used to precisely identify the
Original TRAINER.
The ID No. does not change even if the
POKéMON is traded.

PP stands for “Power Points.”
It indicates the number of times a
certain move can be used in battle.
Like HP, PP can be restored by visiting
a POKéMON CENTER or using certain
items.

POWER indicates the strength of an
attack. The higher this number, the
greater the damage that can be
inflicted on the foe!

ACCURACY indicates the probability of
the move hitting the foe.
The higher this number, the more likely
the move will strike the target.

FNT stands for “fainted.”
A POKéMON faints if its HP is reduced
to zero. It becomes incapable of taking
part in battle.
Restore a fainted POKéMON at a POKéMON
CENTER, or use an item.

Ordinary items bought at any POKéMON
MART are placed in the ITEMS POCKET.
Items may be used, given to a POKéMON
to hold, or tossed out as garbage.

Important items that you find or 
receive from people are placed in the
KEY ITEMS POCKET.
Key items may be used, or registered
for use instantly with SELECT. Once
registered, the item can be used
without opening the MENU and BAG.

POKé BALLS, which are used for
catching wild POKéMON, are placed in
the POKé BALLS POCKET.
POKé BALLS may be bought at POKéMON
MARTS. They may be used, given to a
POKéMON to hold, or tossed out as
garbage.

This indicates the number of species of
POKéMON you have caught and/or
evolved to fill the POKéDEX.
Try hard to catch all sorts of
POKéMON!

This is the total amount of time that
you have played this game.

The POKéMON LEAGUE BADGES that you
have won are registered and shown.
Earn BADGES by defeating GYM LEADERS
in various cities and towns.

You can adjust how quickly the text is
displayed. Choose one: SLOW, MID,
or FAST.

You can choose to turn the battle
animation ON or OFF.

You can choose whether or not a
TRAINER can switch a POKéMON after
it has made its foe faint.
Set to “SHIFT” if you would like the
chance to switch a POKéMON after it
has made its foe faint.

You can choose between MONO and
STEREO sound output.

Set to “HELP” to display help messages
by pressing the L or R Button.
Set to “LR” to enable the switching

A TM (Technical Machine) is a device
used to teach a move to a POKéMON.
There are many different kinds.
Moves can be taught only to those
POKéMON capable of using them.
A TM breaks after a single use.

An HM (Hidden Machine) is a device used
to teach a HIDDEN move to a POKéMON.
A HIDDEN move can be taught only to
those POKéMON capable of using it.
Unlike a TM, an HM can be used over
and over. A HIDDEN move can be tough
for a POKéMON to forget.

HIDDEN moves are those that are
especially important for your
adventure. To use such a move outside
of battle, open the “POKéMON” MENU
and make the POKéMON that knows the
move use it. A fainted POKéMON may use
a HIDDEN move outside of battle.

Among POKéMON, there are some that
undergo major changes (evolution) upon
growing to certain levels. Evolution
causes a POKéMON to alter form, change
its name, and perhaps change the moves
it may learn. Some POKéMON evolve
due to reasons other than leveling up.

Status problems include:
Sleep: Can’t use moves.
Poison: Causes steady HP loss.
Paralysis: May prevent moves.
Burn: HP loss and lowers ATTACK.
Freeze: Can’t use moves.
These can be healed with items, etc.

POKéMON is a name given to describe
wondrous creatures that inhabit all
corners of this world.
People raise POKéMON to be their pets,
use them for battling, and so on.

The ID No. is a special number assigned
specifically to you as a TRAINER.
Together with the OT name, the ID No.
is used to precisely identify the
Original TRAINER.
The ID No. does not change even if the
POKéMON is traded.

Whenever you win a battle against a
TRAINER, you are given prize money.
Save up your prize money so you can
enjoy shopping at POKéMON MARTS!

Ah, it’s you! Your {FD02} and
{FD03} are doing fine.

I really will keep it.
You do want this, yes?

I’m the DAY-CARE LADY
e can raise POKéMON for you
ould you like us to raise one?

Which POKéMON should we raise for
you?

Fine, we’ll raise your {FD02}
for a while
ome back for it later.

We can raise two of your POKéMON
ould you like us to raise one
more POKéMON for you?

My husband was looking for you.

Oh, fine, then.
Come again.

You don’t have enough money…

Will you take back the other one,
too?

Fine.
Come again.

Ah, it’s you!
Good to see you
our POKéMON can only be doing
good!

By level, your {FD02} has
grown by {FD03}.

Your POKéMON party is full.
Make room, then come see me.

If you want your {FD02} back,
it will cost ¥{FD03}.

Perfect!
Here’s your POKéMON.

{RED} took back {FD02} from
the DAY-CARE LADY.

Oh? But you have just one
POKéMON
ome back another time.

Will you take your POKéMON back?

If you leave me that POKéMON,
what will you battle with
ome back another time.

Huh?

REPEL’s effect wore off…

Would you like to exit the SAFARI
ZONE right now?

PA: Ding-dong
ime’s up
A: Your SAFARI GAME is over!

PA: Ding-dong
ou are out of SAFARI BALLS
A: Your SAFARI GAME is over!

Excuse me!
Your PC BOX is full.

It’s crammed full of POKéMON
books.

A TOWN MAP.

Wow!
Tons of POKéMON stuff!

Dishes and plates are neatly
lined up.

It smells delicious!
Somebody’s been cooking here.

It’s a nicely made dresser.
It will hold a lot of stuff.

There’s a pile of snacks here.

All your item needs fulfilled!

INDIGO PLATEA
he highest POKéMON authority!
POKéMON LEAGUE HQ

It should be packed with all kinds
of delicious things to eat.

It’s a blueprint of some sort.
It’s filled with diagrams and text.

It’s a pretty picture of a POKéMON.
It looks like it’s feeling good.

What could this machine be?
Better not mess around with it!

It’s a telephone.
Better not use it.

It’s all complicated words and
numbers that make no sense…

It’s an advertising poster about
all kinds of products.

Oh, that smells tasty!
It might get the stomach growling!

Inside this…
…
here’s nothing here!

It’s a cup with a POKéMON mark
on it.

The window is very well polished.

Outside the window
he sky looks fantastically
beautiful.

Lights in different colors are
flashing on and off.

All sorts of tools are lined up
neatly.

It’s a machine of some sort.
It sure is impressive.

It’s the latest video game!
It sure looks fun!

There are obvious signs of burglary
here…

There’s a POKéMON on TV!
It looks like it’s having fun.

The battery isn’t charged enough
o. of steps required to fully
charge the battery: {FD02}

There are no TRAINERS within range
who can battle
he VS SEEKER was turned off.

The other TRAINERS don’t appear
to be ready for battle
et’s wait till later.

Hey!
I saw you in VIRIDIAN FOREST!

Hi! I like shorts!
They’re comfy and easy to wear
ou should be wearing shorts, too!

Excuse me!
You keep looking at me, don’t you?

You’re a TRAINER, aren’t you?
Let’s get with it right away!

That look you give me…
It intrigues me so!

Hey! What’s wrong with you?
You’re still not wearing shorts!

I’ll battle you with the POKéMON
I started raising.

Eek!
Did you push me?

I always catch mushroom POKéMON
on MT. MOON.

Oh! You’re that nosy kid who
eavesdropped on us!

Excuse me! Didn’t I tell you that
this is a private conversation
ou shouldn’t be listening in,
you uncouth person!

I’m trying to find something good
that’s not a BUG POKéMON, but…

Huh?
You want to go with me again?

Me?
Well, okay. I’ll play this once.

Hey, long time!
Have you gotten better?

You are good at POKéMON, but how
is your chemistry grade?

All right!
Let’s play another game!

You need strategy to win at
battling
re you following my advice?

I’ve collected many NIDORAN.
I don’t want them to evolve, but…

School is fun, but I still think
POKéMON are fun, too.

MEOWTH and PERSIAN are so cute,
meow, meow, meow!

We may look silly standing here
like this, but I can still battle.

I’m a rambling, gaming dude!
I’m on a winning streak!

What’s a cute, round, and fluffy
POKéMON
ou already know, don’t you?

My bike’s still acting up, man.

Okay, kid!
Don’t expect mercy this time!

ELI: Our twin power became even
better!

ANNE: Our twin power powered up!

We’re to battle again?
This time, you’re mine!

I haven’t forgotten you were with
those good-looking POKéMON.

I’m taking ROCK TUNNEL to go to
LAVENDER
ut I keep getting stopped by
everyone along the way…

Don’t you dare patronize me today!
We’re playing for keeps!

Bwahaha!
Great! I was bored again, eh!

Hahaha!
A little toughie, as always!

I got up early every day to train
my POKéMON from cocoons!

Hahahaha!
I’ll win this time!

Go win, my super BUG POKéMON!

Wow, you came here again?
Maybe you’re a POKéMANIAC, too?
Want to see my collection?

Ha-hahah-ah-ha!
I can’t stop sneezing!

Hi, kid!
Did I show you my POKéMON?

I went out to a POKéMON GYM again
But I lost as usual.

Ah!
This mountain air is delicious!
It’s so good, I can’t leave!

My head is starting to spin.
I’ve been hiking for too long…

Win, lose, or draw!
Now for our rematch!

Competing is the ultimate thrill.
I still can’t get enough!

You know, right?
Let’s go, but don’t cheat!

Hi, there
ut be careful!
I’m still laying down some cables!

I became a TRAINER a while ago.
But, I think I can win.

Fwahaha!
I have never lost
And if I did, I’ve forgotten all
about it!

I have never won before
erhaps I am destined to remain
that way…

I’m the best in my class.
I train every morning and night!

Keep your eyes out for live wires!

I raised my POKéMON carefully.
They should be ready by now.
This time, they should win, too.

Yeah!
I got a bite, here!
Th-this might be the real thing!

You’re finally here.
Fishing is a waiting game.

Still can’t find a MOON STONE…
Have you found one?

Electricity has always been my
specialty
 don’t know a thing about POKéMON
of the sea, though.

The FISHING FOOL vs. POKéMON KID!
Another round, fight!

I love fishing, don’t get me wrong.
But, I wish I had more work…
…It’s hard to give up fishing!

What’s catching
ou’ll never know unless you beat
me!

JES: I’ll win here today and
propose to my GIA.

GIA: Hey, JES…
I’ve been waiting a long time now
f we win today, I’ll marry you!

My bird POKéMON remember you!

I want to be the best TRAINER 
while I’m a kid!

Wow!
You got more cool BADGES!

My cutely grown POKéMON wish to
become reacquainted with you.

I cleaned out my savings and
bought more CARBOS.

I’m not going to lose this time.
The wind’s blowing my way!

Oh, you’re back
ure, I’ll play again with you,
sweetie.

Can’t you forget that you battled
with me?

What’re you starin’ at?

I always go with bird POKéMON.
I’ve dedicated myself to them.

I used TMs to teach good moves
to my POKéMON.

My bird POKéMON should be ready
for battle this time.

Are you using TMs on POKéMON?
Just holding them is useless.

Have you taught your bird POKéMON
how to FLY
ou’ll be able to soar with it into
the sky! Give it a try.

The legend of the winged mirages…
You’ve heard it, right?

I’m really not into it, but okay.
Let’s go!

Hey!
I remember you
’mon, c’mon.
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!

You’re here again, huh?
Shut up and battle.

We’ve been riding here because of
the wide-open spaces.

POKéMON battle, right?
Cool! Rumble!

KIRI: JAN, I hope we win today.

JAN: KIRI, here we go!
Let’s win for sure this time!

I’m going to keep battling with the
POKéMON I got in trades.

You look gentle, so I think I can
beat you
’ll give it one more go!

When I whistle, bird POKéMON
gather around
hey’re amazingly cute!

Hmm? My birds are shivering!
Wait, aren’t you that TRAINER…

Oh, you’re a little cutie!
So like a darling POKéMON!
I remember you now!

I raise POKéMON for protection
because I live alone
hat hasn’t changed.

Hey, kid! C’mon!
I got these off some loser!

Fork over all your cash when you
lose to me, kid!

What’s cool and happening?
Trading POKéMON, of course.

Want to play with my POKéMON
again?

MYA: Hi, we keep meeting,
don’t we
elp me train my little brother
again?

RON: My sister’s gotten more
powerful…

What do you want?

Nice BIKE!
Hand it over quick!

Come out and play, little mouse.
I’ll treat you right!

Hey, wait a second!
Don’t call me and then run away!

I’m feeling hungry and mean!
I really need a punching bag!

Hey, there!
We’ll have ourselves a good time!

JED: Are you here to see our
love, which knows no bounds?

LEA: Sometimes, the intensity of
our love scares me.

I told you, there’s no getting rich
quick in battling kids.

I’m mighty proud of my bod, kiddo.
Come on!

You out for a stroll?

We’re BIKERS!
We rule the roads, man!

VOLTORB’s going to seriously
electrify you today!

I leveled up my POKéMON, but it
absolutely won’t evolve. Why?

Gaah! I really need to exercise
and seriously trim some flab!

Be a rebel!

Yep, that’s a nice BIKE!
How’s it handle?

Get lost, kid!
I’m bushed!

I’ve been checking every grassy
area for new POKéMON
ut it’s not always easy…

Koorukukukoo!
Is my birdcall getting better?

I warned you before, this is my
turf
 don’t want you coming around.

I’m almost warmed up to go
out for a swim.

Wait! Slow down!
What if you have a heart attack?

I love swimming!
I guess you’re the surfing type.

What’s beyond the horizon?
Have you seen?

I tried diving for POKéMON again,
but it was a no-go like before.

I look at the sea to forget all
the bad things that happened
Like losing to you the last time!

You always get to ride your
POKéMON
t looks so relaxing.
Can I have it if I win?

Swimming’s great!
Sunburns aren’t!

These waters are treacherous!
You shouldn’t come back here!

I swam here with my friends…
I’m tired…
Must we really battle again?

LIA: You know my brother just
became a TRAINER, right
 want to make him better, so I
need your help again.

LUC: My big sis taught me all
about POKéMON
 wonder if I’m better?

The water is shallow here.
There are many people swimming.

Are you jealous that I’m
vacationing on SEAFOAM?

I love floating with the fishes
here among the waves.

Were you on vacation, too?

Check out my physique
t’s even more buff than ever
before!

Why are you riding a POKéMON?
Haven’t you learned to swim yet?

I rode my bird POKéMON here.

My boyfriend gave me big pearls.
And, they’ve grown bigger!

I swam here from CINNABAR ISLAND.
It wasn’t easy, like I said.

CINNABAR, in the west, has a LAB
for POKéMON
y daddy works there.

You want to know if the fish are
biting?

I got a big haul again!
Wanna go for it once more?

The sea cleanses my body and soul!

I caught my POKéMON at sea.
And that’s where I train them.

Right now, I’m in another triathlon
meet!

Ahh!
Feel the sun and the wind!

Hey, cut it out already.
You always scare away the fish!

Keep me company till I get a hit.

LIL: Huh? A battle again?
IAN, can’t you do it alone?

IAN: My sis is still a slob.
Help me get her into shape!

I won’t lose while I’m here!

Dad took me to a great party on
the S.S. ANNE at VERMILION CITY.

I’m a cool guy.
I’ve got a girlfriend
’ll show her how cool I am for
sure this time!

Hi!
My boyfriend is cool!
My conditioning’s good today!

I had this feeling…
I knew I had to battle you again!

My friend has many cute POKéMON.
I’m so jealous!

I just trained up on MT. MOON,
but I’ve still got gas in the tank!

A POKéMANIAC lives on the cape.
Have you seen his collection?

You’re going to see BILL again?
First, we battle!

I saw your feat from the grass!

Okay!
I’ll stomp you!

You always look so busy…
Aren’t you getting tired?

You really must love coming to
NUGGET BRIDGE.

The time we battled
ven though I was the second in
line, I was the best, wasn’t I?

People call this the NUGGET
BRIDGE
ou’ve already beaten us, so you’re
not allowed to take the challenge
But, you’re welcome to battle with
us again.

Lying back, rocked by the waves…
I don’t notice time slipping by…

The weather’s gorgeous!
I’ll try not to spoil it.

My sunburn is starting to hurt…

The fire bird’s mountain casts
a huge shadow…

I have this strong feeling that
I can win this time!

Wait! Wait a second!
I’m sure I’ve hooked a big one!

You’ll help me out with my
training again?

We haven’t missed a single day of
training yet!

Every morning, before breakfast,
I swim around this island…
Three times!

Dress appropriately for battle!
Lose that frivolous outfit, I said!

You know, everything tastes great
when you’re out in the wild.

I ate too much again, so will you
battle us for some exercise?

KIA: My big brother and I make
an awesome combination
e won’t lose this time!

MIK: Together with KIA, we’re
afraid of nothing
e’ll prove it to you this time!

Are we to battle again?

From where have you come, and
where are you bound?

I want to swim without my float
ring soon.

Yay, yay!
POKéMON!

Oh, no, didn’t I tell you already?
Please, stay away from me!

JOY: We’ve gotten stronger!
Lots and lots!

MEG: You can’t beat us today!

Oh, hello
re you raising your POKéMON in a
good environment?

With these hands, I will create
my victory today.

Must I repeat myself?
I’m trying to paint.
Please keep out of my sight!

I haven’t made any progress…
I still can’t get the right angle…

Oh, you will give me another
opportunity to match wits with you?

They’re almost finished making the
pool for my POKéMON
ou must drop in for a visit.

I’m a good runner.
I’ve gotten even faster!

I say, friend!
Let us enjoy our time together!

I’m the eldest of the BIRD
BROTHERS. Remember me
hat’s right, I’m the one who loves
birds for their beaks!

I’m the middle kid of the BIRD
BROTHERS
’m the one that loves wings.
Let’s battle again!

I’m the youngest of the BIRD
BROTHERS
 love birds for their down.
I didn’t think I’d see you again!

I’m still having no luck at all.
A battle’d be a change of pace!

Gasp… Gasp
 swam here from SIX ISLAND’s port
in one go again.

You always come along while I’m
swimming.

AVA: Let’s have another
two-on-two marine battle today!

GEB: My big sister and I are way
tougher than before!

…Huh
 envision my house, but TELEPORT
always brings me here!

Oh, hello.
A pleasant breeze is blowing again.

Hehehe, I’m practicing in secret
again.

What, you’re sick of seeing
SWIMMERS like me
ww, don’t be hatin’!
Battle with me again.

Sigh…
My boyfriend’s busy again…

Come on, tell me, where are the
mountains around these parts?

MIU: Hello, POKéMON!
It’s time to play again!

MIA: Hello, POKéMON!
It’s time to battle again!

There appear to be many secrets
still unsolved in this world.

Hi, didn’t we meet before?
What compelled you to come back?

It’s been said that there are
mysterious stones on this island
ave you discovered anything since
we last met?

A rematch with you, so high up!

I’m pretty familiar with the land
around these parts.

I sensed your approach.

Somewhere on this island, peculiar
POKéMON are sleeping.

Kyahaha
oming back won’t change a thing.
I’ll flick you away effortlessly!

Howdy! You’re a member of my
fan club, isn’t that right?

This island is too spread out…
Patrolling the place is a drag…

I don’t forgive people who abuse
POKéMON!

EVE: I’ll team up with JON and
battle together again.

JON: When I’m with EVE, it feels
like we could never lose, not ever.

Let’s have another battle.
My conditioning’s in top form!

It doesn’t matter if you happen to
have the strongest POKéMON
t doesn’t mean a thing if you don’t
know how to use them properly!

I work to protect the environment.
In turn, nature protects me!

Every time we meet, you have those
snazzy shoes on.

You must have gotten tougher.
Let me battle you, please!

I was given the best possible
education to become this strong
 won’t lose this time.
Absolutely not!

LEX: My darling NYA, together
we will win for certain!

NYA: I won’t drag down my mentor
LEX! We’re going to win!

Have you discovered anything about
this stone chamber?

A mystic POKéMON is said to sleep
inside here.

My teacher is showing me how to
paint some more.

Today, in addition to our lesson,
we came to see the chamber again.

Would you like to save the game?

There is already a saved file.
Is it okay to overwrite it?

Hello, there!
Glad to meet you
elcome to the world of POKéMON
y name is OAK
eople affectionately refer to me
as the POKéMON PROFESSOR.


This world…

…is inhabited far and wide by
creatures called POKéMON.


For some people, POKéMON are pets.
Others use them for battling
s for myself
 study POKéMON as a profession.


But first, tell me a little about
yourself.


Let’s begin with your name.
What is it?


Right…
So your name is {RED}.

This is my grandson
e’s been your rival since you both
were babies
Erm, what was his name now?

Your rival’s name, what was it now?

…Er, was it {GREEN}?

That’s right! I remember now!
His name is {GREEN}!


{RED}
our very own POKéMON legend is
about to unfold
 world of dreams and adventures
with POKéMON awaits! Let’s go!

POKé DUDE: The speedier of the
battlers gets to attack first.

It looks like my RATTATA was
faster than the PIDGEY.

The battlers take turns attacking
and reducing each other’s HP.

My RATTATA reduced the foe’s HP
to zero, so it wins
he POKéMON that took part in the
battle get EXP. Points
hen a POKéMON collects enough
EXP. Points, it levels up
eveling up makes your POKéMON
stronger than before.

POKé DUDE: Uh-oh…
My RATTATA has been poisoned
f a POKéMON is poisoned, it loses
HP steadily.

If a POKéMON develops a status
problem, heal it right away.

Using an item on a POKéMON uses
up one turn, though
ow, it’s the opponent’s turn!

Yay!
We managed to win!

POKé DUDE: The move BUBBLE is
a WATER-type attack
he targeted ODDISH is a
GRASS/POISON-type POKéMON
he WATER-type attack is absorbed
by the GRASS-type POKéMON
s a result, the move becomes not
very effective, and inflicts only
half the usual damage.

Uh-oh, this is not good
he ABSORB attack you just saw
is a GRASS-type move
OLIWAG is a WATER-type POKéMON
o, ABSORB becomes super
effective, doubling the damage.

It’s not going to be easy to win
with this matchup
et’s try shifting POKéMON!

Shifting POKéMON in and out uses
up one turn
ow, it’s the opponent’s turn.

BUTTERFREE is a BUG/FLYING-type
POKéMON
gainst this POKéMON, a GRASS-
type attack
inflicts only half the usual
damage on a BUG-type POKéMON
And, it also causes only half the
damage on a FLYING-type POKéMON
herefore, BUTTERFREE, being a
BUG/FLYING POKéMON, only takes
one quarter of the usual damage.

ODDISH is a GRASS/POISON-type
POKéMON
 FLYING- or PSYCHIC-type attack
is super effective against it
ne of those types of attacks will
inflict double the usual damage
kay, here we go!

Yeah!
We won!

POKé DUDE: When you’re trying to
catch a POKéMON, don’t throw any
POKé BALLS right away
irst, you need to weaken it by
reducing its HP.

Okay, that should be good enough
ut, if it’s possible, it would be
best if the target has a status
problem
or instance, it would be easier
to catch if it were asleep or
paralyzed.

This will make the POKéMON a lot
easier to catch
h, yes. If you paralyze a
POKéMON, you can’t make it fall
asleep on top of paralysis
n other words, you can’t double
up status problems, okay?

Okay!
Let me throw my POKé BALL!

Before you throw a POKé BALL,
consider the condition and the
type of POKéMON, and pick the kind
of BALL that would work best.

I… I’ll do my best!

OAK: Oh, for Pete’s sake…
So pushy, as always
FD23}
ou’ve never had a POKéMON battle
before, have you
 POKéMON battle is when TRAINERS
pit their POKéMON against each
other.


The TRAINER that makes the other
TRAINER’s POKéMON faint by lowering
their HP to “0,” wins.


But rather than talking about it,
you’ll learn more from experience
ry battling and see for yourself.


OAK: Inflicting damage on the foe
is the key to any battle.


OAK: Lowering the foe’s stats
will put you at an advantage.


OAK: Keep your eyes on your
POKéMON’s HP
t will faint if the HP drops to
“0.”


OAK: No! There’s no running away
from a TRAINER POKéMON battle!


OAK: Hm! Excellent
f you win, you earn prize money,
and your POKéMON will grow
attle other TRAINERS and make
your POKéMON strong!


OAK: Hm…
How disappointing
f you win, you earn prize money,
and your POKéMON grow
ut if you lose, {FD23}, you end
up paying prize money
owever, since you had no warning
this time, I’ll pay for you
ut things won’t be this way once
you step outside these doors
hat’s why you must strengthen your
POKéMON by battling wild POKéMON.

Hey, all you TRAINERS out there!
HELLO, TRAINERS
…… ……… ……
ome on, let me hear you!
HELLO, TRAINERS!
It’s me, the POKé DUDE!


Today, the POKé DUDE’s here to
tell you about how you can battle
POKéMON
ay you’re out for a stroll when,
suddenly, a wild POKéMON appears
t’s up to you to smartly use your
POKéMON and their moves to reduce
the opponent’s HP to nothing, and
claim victory
’ll show you how to do that in
person and for sure
ll righty, here goes
eep your eyes glued to the super
POKé DUDE SHOW!

Well, did you get that
ven if your own POKéMON’s HP
falls to zero, and it becomes
unable to battle, not to worry
ust take it to any POKéMON
CENTER and heal it
ll righty, be seeing you
emember, TRAINERS, a good deed
a day brings happiness to stay!

Today, the POKé DUDE’s here to
tell you about status problems
tatus problems include poisoning,
paralysis, sleep, burn
here are a couple others, but
they really are trouble
et any one, and your POKéMON
may become useless in battle
ou know, it hurts the POKé DUDE
to see a POKéMON suffer
o, what should you do if your
POKéMON gets a status problem
ell, you’ve got me to show you
ll righty, here goes
eep your eyes glued to the super
POKé DUDE SHOW!

Poisoning or paralysis don’t go
away after a battle
f a POKéMON is poisoned, it loses
HP even while you’re walking
ou should heal POKéMON of these
kinds of problems right away
se an item, or try to get to a
POKéMON CENTER for healing
hat wasn’t hard, was it?
All righty, be seeing you
emember, TRAINERS, a good deed
a day brings happiness to stay!

Does everyone know about type
matchups
OKéMON and their moves all
belong to certain types
or example, there are such types
as GRASS and WATER
ou need to consider the type of
the move used to attack
nd, the type of the POKéMON that
is hit by that attack
epending on how those two types
match up, the damage can change
ou see, it depends on whether
the type matchup is good or bad
f you don’t know how matchups
work, battles will be tough
o, let me demonstrate exactly
what I mean
ll righty, here goes
eep your eyes glued to the super
POKé DUDE SHOW!

Is it possible to launch an attack
that will inflict heavy damage
oes the opposing POKéMON pose
a threat to your POKéMON
s there any chance that it may
have disastrously tough moves
atch the type matchups to gain
the upper hand
ll righty, be seeing you
h, for the COOL-type POKé DUDE,
AWESOME-type kids like you match
up perfectly
emember, a good deed a day
brings happiness to stay!

Today, the POKé DUDE’s going to
show you how to catch POKéMON
ust imagine… A groovy POKéMON
suddenly appearing in the wild
h, you want it!
You just can’t help it
h, you have to catch it!
You gotta have it
et me show you how you can make
it happen
ll righty, here goes
eep your eyes glued to the super
POKé DUDE SHOW!

If your first POKé BALL fails to
catch the POKéMON, don’t give up
eep throwing POKé BALLS…
It’s bound to work sometime
ll righty, be seeing you
emember, TRAINERS, a good deed
a day brings happiness to stay!

Hey, everyone!
Do you all have TMs
 TM, Technical Machine, is an
amazingly great item
t teaches POKéMON a move that
it may not learn when leveling up
sn’t that just great? What a
convenient world we live in
pen the TM CASE and check out
the TMs you have
ou can check them out in detail,
too.

POKé DUDE: NORMAL, WATER, GRASS…
TMs also come in types
heck the type and teach it to
a POKéMON that matches up well
or example, WATER PULSE is
suitable for WATER-type POKéMON
ULLET SEED is a move that most
GRASS-type POKéMON can learn
here’s one other thing!

Don’t just look at the type, read
the description, too
t will contain hints about what
POKéMON might learn the move
or example, take a move like
FOCUS PUNCH
t doesn’t sound like anything a
bird or fish POKéMON can learn
o, try using it on POKéMON with
arms that can throw punches!

Wow, I talked a lot today!
All righty, be seeing you
emember, TRAINERS, a good deed
a day brings happiness to stay!

A TRAINER’s BAG has a bunch of
nifty, convenient features
ake stuff in the KEY ITEMS
POCKET, for instance
ou can use a key item without
opening the BAG every time
or example, let’s pretend I have
a TEACHY TV in my BAG
 can register it for instant use,
and I’ll show you how
ll righty, here goes
eep your eyes glued to the sorta
super POKé DUDE SHOW!

And now, your TEACHY TV is
registered
ow do you use it?
Well, here’s how it works
nce an item in the KEY ITEMS
POKCET is registered, you can use
it by pressing SELECT
o, you’ve given yourself
one-touch access to TEACHY TV
ll it takes for you to see me is
pressing one button
hat kind of attention is a little
embarrassing
ll righty, be seeing you
emember, TRAINERS, a good deed
a day brings happiness to stay!

This is a newly discovered POKéMON. It is
currently under investigation. No detailed
information is available at this time.


There is a plant seed on its back right
from the day this POKéMON is born.
The seed slowly grows larger.


There is a plant bulb on its back.
When it absorbs nutrients, the bulb is said
to blossom into a large flower.


A bewitching aroma wafts from its flower.
The fragrance becalms those engaged in
a battle.


From the time it is born, a flame burns
at the tip of its tail. Its life would end
if the flame were to go out.


It lashes about with its tail to knock
down its foe. It then tears up the fallen
opponent with sharp claws.


Its wings can carry this POKéMON close to
an altitude of 4,600 feet. It blows out
fire at very high temperatures.


When it retracts its long neck into its
shell, it squirts out water with vigorous
force.


This POKéMON is very popular as a pet.
Its fur-covered tail is a symbol of its
longevity.


It crushes its foe under its heavy body
to cause fainting. In a pinch, it will
withdraw inside its shell.


It is covered with a green skin. When it
grows, it sheds the skin, covers itself
with silk, and becomes a cocoon.


Even though it is encased in a sturdy
shell, the body inside is tender.
It can’t withstand a harsh attack.


The wings are protected by rain-repellent
dust. As a result, this POKéMON can fly
about even in rain.


Often found in forests and grasslands.
It has a sharp, toxic barb of around two
inches on top of its head.


This POKéMON is in a temporary stage
while making its body. It is almost
completely unable to move on its own.


May appear in a swarm. Flies at violent
speeds, all the while stabbing with the
toxic stinger on its rear.


Does not like to fight. It hides in
tall grass and so on, foraging for food
such as small bugs.


The claws on its feet are well developed.
It can carry prey such as an EXEGGCUTE
to its nest over 60 miles away.


It spreads its gorgeous wings widely to
intimidate enemies. It races through the
skies at Mach-2 speed.


Its fangs are long and very sharp.
They grow continuously, so it gnaws on
hard things to whittle them down.


Its rear feet have three toes each.
They are webbed, enabling it to swim
across rivers.


It busily flits around here and there.
Even if it is frail, it can be a tough
foe that uses MIRROR MOVE.


Its huge and magnificent wings can keep it
aloft in the sky. It can remain flying a
whole day without landing.


A very common sight in grassland, etc.
It flicks its tongue in and out to sense
danger in its surroundings.


The pattern on its belly appears to be a
frightening face. Weak foes will flee just
at the sight of the pattern.


It has small electric sacs on both its
cheeks. If threatened, it looses electric
charges from the sacs.


Its electric charges can reach even
100,000 volts. Careless contact can cause
even an Indian elephant to faint.


It burrows and lives underground.
If threatened, it curls itself up into a
ball for protection.


It is adept at attacking with the spines
on its back and its sharp claws while
quickly scurrying about.


Though small, it must be treated with
caution because of its powerfully toxic
barbs. The female has smaller horns.


The female has a gentle temperament.
It emits ultrasonic cries that have the
power to befuddle foes.


The body is covered by stiff, needle-
like scales. If it becomes excited,
the needles bristle outwards.


Its large ears are flapped like wings
when it is listening to distant sounds.
It extends toxic barbs when angered.


It is easily angered. By swinging its well-
developed horn wildly, it can even punch
through diamond.


It is recognized by its rock-hard hide
and its extended horn. Be careful with
the horn as it contains venom.


Its adorable appearance makes it popular
as a pet. However, it is rare and
difficult to find.


It has an acute sense of hearing. It can
easily hear a pin being dropped nearly
1,100 yards away.


While young, it has six gorgeous tails.
When it grows, several new tails are
sprouted.


It has nine long tails and fur that 
gleams gold. It is said to live for 
1,000 years.


It captivates foes with its huge, round
eyes, then lulls them to sleep by singing
a soothing melody.


Its fur is extremely fine, dense, and
supple. The exquisitely pleasant fur
conveys an image of luxury.


It has no eyes. Instead, it relies on
its ultrasonic cries for echo location to
flit about in darkness.


It clamps down on its prey with needle-
sharp fangs and drains over 10 ounces of
blood in one gulp.


Its scientific name is “Oddium Wanderus.”
At night, it is said to walk nearly 1,000
feet on its two roots.


Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor.
The horrid stench can cause fainting at a
distance of 1.25 miles.


Its petals are the largest in the world.
It fiendishly scatters allergy-causing
pollen from its petals.


Growing out of the bug’s back are
mushrooms called tochukaso. The mushrooms
grow with the bug host.


It scatters toxic spores from the
mushroom cap. In China, the spores are
used as herbal medicine.


Its eyes act as radar, enabling it to be
active in darkness. The eyes can also
shoot powerful beams.


The wings are covered with dustlike
scales. Every time it flaps its wings, it
looses highly toxic dust.


It burrows through the ground at a
shallow depth. It leaves raised earth in
its wake, making it easy to spot.


In battle, it digs through the ground and
strikes the unsuspecting foe from an
unexpected direction.


All it does is sleep during the daytime.
At night, it patrols its territory with its
eyes aglow.


Has a vicious temperament. Beware if it
raises its tail straight up. It is a signal
that it is about to pounce and bite.


It is constantly wracked by a headache.
When the headache turns intense, it begins
using mysterious powers.


The forelegs are webbed, helping to make
it an adept swimmer. It can be seen
swimming elegantly in lakes, etc.


Light and agile on its feet, and ferocious
in temperament. When angered, it flies into
an uncontrollable frenzy.


It is always outrageously furious. If it
gives chase, it will tenaciously track the
target no matter how far.


Very friendly and faithful to people.
It will try to repel enemies by barking
and biting.


A POKéMON that is described in Chinese
legends. It is said to race at an
unbelievable speed.


Its slick black skin is thin and damp.
A part of its internal organs can be seen
through the skin as a spiral pattern.


Its two legs are well developed.
Even though it can live on the ground,
it prefers living in water.


An adept swimmer, it knows the front
crawl, butterfly, and more. It is faster
than the best human swimmers.


It sleeps for 18 hours a day. It uses a
variety of extrasensory powers even
while asleep.


It happened one morning - a boy with
extrasensory powers awoke in bed
transformed into KADABRA.


It does not like physical attacks very 
much. Instead, it freely uses extra-
sensory powers to defeat foes.


Its whole body is composed of muscles.
Even though it’s the size of a human
child, it can hurl 100 grown-ups.


Its formidable body never gets tired.
It helps people by doing work such as
the moving of heavy goods.


Its four ruggedly developed arms can
launch a flurry of 1,000 punches in just
two seconds.


Its bud looks like a human face. Because
of the bud, it is rumored to be a type of
legendary mandrake plant.


The leafy parts act as cutters for
slashing foes. It spits a fluid that
dissolves everything.


Lures prey into its mouth with a honeylike
aroma. The helpless prey is melted with
a dissolving fluid.


Its eyes are as transparent as crystals.
From them, it shoots mysterious
beams of light.


It has 80 tentacles that move about
freely. They can sting, causing poisoning
and sharp, stabbing pain.


Its round form makes it easy to pick up.
Some people have used them to hurl
at each other in a snowball fight.


Be careful while hiking on mountain trails.
GRAVELER may come rolling down the path
without slowing.


It is enclosed in a hard shell that is as
rugged as slabs of rock. It sheds skin
once a year to grow larger.


Its body is light, and its legs are
incredibly powerful. It can clear
Ayers Rock in one leap.


It can gallop at a top speed of 150
miles per hour. It can race as fast as a
bullet train while ablaze.


It is always vacantly lost in thought, but
no one knows what it is thinking about.
It is good at fishing with its tail.


When a SLOWPOKE went hunting in the sea,
its tail was bitten by a SHELLDER. That
made it evolve into SLOWBRO.


It moves while constantly hovering.
It discharges THUNDER WAVE and so on
from the units at its sides.


A linked cluster formed of several
MAGNEMITE. It discharges powerful
magnetic waves at high voltage.


It always walks about with a plant stalk
clamped in its beak. The stalk is used for
building its nest.


A two-headed POKéMON that was discovered
as a sudden mutation. It runs at a pace
of over 60 miles per hour.


An odd species that is rarely found.
The three heads respectively represent
joy, sadness, and anger.


Covered with light blue fur, its hide is
thick and tough. It is active in bitter
cold of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.


Its body is covered with a pure white
fur. The colder the weather, the more
active it becomes.


Sludge exposed to X rays from the moon
transformed into GRIMER. It loves feeding
on filthy things.


It is usually undetectable because it
blends in with the ground. Touching it can
cause terrible poisoning.


It is encased in a shell that is harder
than diamond. Inside, however, it is
surprisingly tender.


Its shell is extremely hard. It cannot be
shattered, even with a bomb. The shell
opens only when it is attacking.


A being that exists as a thin gas. It can
topple an Indian elephant by enveloping
the prey in two seconds.


If you get the feeling of being watched
in darkness when nobody is around,
HAUNTER is there.


It is said to emerge from darkness to
steal the lives of those who become lost
in mountains.


It usually lives underground. It searches
for food while boring its way through the
ground at 50 miles per hour.


A descendent of the legendary animal
baku, which is said to eat dreams. It is
skilled at hypnotism.


It carries a pendulum-like device. There
once was an incident in which it took 
away a child it hypnotized.


It can be found near the sea. The large
pincers grow back if they are torn out of
their sockets.


Its large and hard pincer has 10,000-
horsepower strength. However, being so
big, it is unwieldy to move.


A life-form whose identity is unknown.
It is said to SCREECH or suddenly
SELFDESTRUCT.


It explodes in response to even minor
stimuli. It is feared, with the nickname
of “The Bomb Ball.”


Even though it appears to be eggs of
some sort, it was discovered to be a life-
form more like plant seeds.


It is called “The Walking Tropical
Rainforest.” Each of the nuts has
a face and a will of its own.


It wears the skull of its dead mother on
its head. When it becomes lonesome, it is
said to cry loudly.


It is small and was originally very weak.
Its temperament turned ferocious when it
began using bones.


The legs freely contract and stretch.
The stretchy legs allow it to hit a
distant foe with a rising kick.


The spirit of a pro boxer has infused this
POKéMON. It throws punches that are
faster than a bullet train.


Its tongue is twice the length of its
body. It can be moved like an arm for
grabbing food and attacking.


Its thin, balloon-like body is inflated by
horribly toxic gases. It reeks when it is
nearby.


Very rarely, a sudden mutation can result
in two small KOFFING twins becoming
conjoined as a WEEZING.


Strong, but not too bright, this POKéMON
can shatter even a skyscraper with its
charging TACKLES.


It begins walking on its hind legs after
evolution. It can punch holes through
boulders with its horn.

on its belly. It is skilled at attacking

Carelessly trying to touch it could cause
fainting from the spikes.

At night, its central core flashes with a
red light.


This POKéMON has a geometric body.
Because of its body, the locals suspect
that it is an alien creature.


It is adept at conning people. It is said
to be able to create walls out of thin
air by miming.


It tears and shreds prey with its wickedly
sharp scythes. It very rarely spreads its
wings to fly.


It speaks using a language that sounds
human. Research is under way to determine
what is being said.


It loves to feed on strong electricity.
It occasionally appears around large
power plants and so on.


Found near the mouth of a volcano.
This fire-breather’s body temperature is
nearly 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit.


Its two long pincer horns are powerful.
Once they grip an enemy, they won’t
release until the foe is torn.


When it is about to TACKLE, it whips
its body repeatedly with its three
long tails.


It is virtually worthless in terms of both
power and speed. It is the most weak and
pathetic POKéMON in the world.


It has an extremely aggressive nature.
The HYPER BEAM it shoots from its mouth
totally incinerates all targets.


Its high intelligence enables it to
understand human speech. It likes to ferry
people on its back.


It can freely recombine its own cellular
structure to transform into other life-
forms.


An extremely rare POKéMON that may
evolve in a number of different ways
depending on stimuli.


Its body’s cellular structure is similar to
the molecular composition of water.
It can melt invisibly in water.


If it is angered or startled, the fur all
over its body bristles like sharp needles
that pierce foes.


It has a flame bag inside its body. After
inhaling deeply, it blows out flames of
nearly 3,100 degrees Fahrenheit.


Using the most advanced technologies,
scientists finally succeeded in making the
first artificial POKéMON.


A prehistoric POKéMON that lived in the
primordial sea, it swims by twisting its
10 tentacles about.


Its tentacles are highly developed as if
they are hands and feet. As soon as it
ensnares prey, it bites.


This POKéMON was regenerated from the
fossil of an ancient creature. It protects
itself with a hard shell.


It swims freely through water. It catches
prey with its scythe-like arms and drains
the victim’s fluids.


It was regenerated from a dinosaur’s
genetic matter that was found in amber.
It flies with high-pitched cries.


It is not satisfied unless it eats over 880
pounds of food every day. When it is done
eating, it goes promptly to sleep.

flying form is magnificent.


One of the legendary bird POKéMON.
While it is flying, it makes crackling and
snapping sounds.


One of the legendary bird POKéMON.
Those seeing it are overwhelmed by its
orange wings that seem to be on fire.


Even the young can exceed 6.5 feet in
length. It grows larger by repeatedly
shedding skin.


It is said to live in seas and lakes.
Even though it has no wings, it has been
seen flying occasionally.


It can fly in spite of its big and bulky
physique. It circles the globe in just
16 hours.


A POKéMON whose genetic code was
repeatedly recombined for research.
It turned vicious as a result.


A POKéMON of South America that was
thought to have been extinct. It is very
intelligent and learns any move.


Its pleasantly aromatic leaves have the
ability to check the humidity and
temperature.


A spicy aroma emanates from around its
neck. The aroma acts as a stimulant to
restore health.


MEGANIUM’s breath has the power to revive
dead grass and plants. It can make them
healthy again.


It usually stays hunched over. If it is
angry or surprised, it shoots flames out
of its back.


This POKéMON is fully covered by
nonflammable fur. It can withstand any
kind of fire attack.


It has a secret, devastating move. It
rubs its blazing fur together to cause
huge explosions.


It is small but rough and tough. It won’t
hesitate to take a bite out of anything
that moves.


It opens its huge jaws wide when
attacking. If it loses any fangs while
biting, they grow back in.


It is hard for it to support its own
weight out of water, so it gets down on
all fours. But it moves fast.


It stands on its tail so it can see a long
way. If it spots an enemy, it cries loudly
to warn its kind.


There is no telling where its tail begins.
Despite its short legs, it is quick at
hunting RATTATA.


It has a perfect sense of time. Whatever
happens, it keeps rhythm by precisely
tilting its head in time.


When it needs to think, it rotates its head
180 degrees to sharpen its intellectual
power.


When the weather turns cold, numerous
LEDYBA gather from everywhere to cluster
and keep each other warm.


The star patterns on its back grow larger
or smaller depending on the number of
stars in the night sky.


It spins a web using fine--but durable--
thread. It then waits patiently for prey
to be trapped.


A single strand of a special string is
endlessly spun out of its rear. The string
leads back to its nest.


The development of wings on its legs
enables it to fly fast but also makes it
tough to stop and rest.


On the dark ocean floor, its only means
of communication is its constantly
flashing lights.


It blinds prey with an intense burst of
light, then swallows the immobilized prey
in a single gulp.


Despite its small size, it can zap even
adult humans. However, if it does so, it
also surprises itself.


When numerous meteors illuminate the
night sky, sightings of CLEFFA strangely
increase.


Its extremely flexible and elastic body
makes it bounce continuously--anytime,
anywhere.


A proverb claims that happiness will come
to anyone who can make a sleeping TOGEPI
stand up.


It grows dispirited if it is not with kind
people. It can float in midair without
moving its wings.


It usually forages for food on the ground
but may, on rare occasions, hop onto
branches to peck at shoots.


In South America, it is said that its right
eye sees the future and its left eye
views the past.


Its fleece grows continually. In the
summer, the fleece is fully shed, but it
grows back in a week.


Its fluffy fleece easily stores
electricity. Its rubbery hide keeps it
from being electrocuted.


The bright light on its tail can be seen
far away. It has been treasured since
ancient times as a beacon.


Plentiful in the tropics. When it dances,
its petals rub together and make a
pleasant ringing sound.


The end of its tail serves as a buoy that
keeps it from drowning, even in a vicious
current.


When it plays in water, it rolls up its
elongated ears to prevent their insides
from getting wet.


It disguises itself as a tree to avoid
attack. It hates water, so it will
disappear if it starts raining.


Whenever three or more of these get
together, they sing in a loud voice that
sounds like bellowing.


Its body is so light, it must grip the
ground firmly with its feet to keep from
being blown away.


It spreads its petals to absorb sunlight.
It also floats in the air to get closer to
the sun.


It drifts on seasonal winds and spreads
its cotton-like spores all over the world 
to make more offspring.


It lives atop tall trees. When leaping
from branch to branch, it deftly uses its
tail for balance.


It lives by drinking only dewdrops from
under the leaves of plants. It is said
that it eats nothing else.


In the daytime, it rushes about in a
hectic manner, but it comes to a complete
stop when the sun sets.


Its large eyes can scan 360 degrees.
It looks in all directions to seek out
insects as its prey.


When it walks around on the ground,
it coats its body with a slimy, poisonous
film.


Due to its relaxed and carefree attitude,
it often bumps its head on boulders and
boat hulls as it swims.


By reading air currents, it can predict
things such as the weather or its foe’s
next move.


When darkness falls, the rings on its body
begin to glow, striking fear in the hearts
of anyone nearby.


It is said that when chased, it lures its
