## About this Fork

This repository is a fork of [pret/pokefirered](https://github.com/pret/pokefirered), aiming to translate Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen to be fully playable in **Hebrew**.

- **Work in Progress:**
  - The translation is ongoing. Some screens may still be incorrectly formatted, and some text may be untranslated or incorrectly translated.
- **Contributions:**
  - Issues and pull requests are welcome! Please note that this is a personal project done in my free time, so I can't guarantee when I'll be able to address them.

## Credits

A special thanks to the team behind [Nog-Frog/pokered](https://github.com/Nog-Frog/pokered) — a lot of the early translation work for this project was inspired by (and in some cases taken from) their Hebrew translation of Pokémon Red/Blue. Their efforts and resources were invaluable in getting this project started.
